[0.00s -> 5.08s]  This episode is brought to you by Arcteryx.
[5.08s -> 10.68s]  When Jordan Cannon, a young climber infatuated with climbing history, meets climbing legend
[10.68s -> 16.08s]  Mark Hudon, a Yosemite Big Wall free-climbing pioneer, they form an unlikely partnership
[16.08s -> 17.60s]  around a common goal.
[17.60s -> 22.60s]  Jordan wants to free-climb the Free Rider on El Capitan in a day, and Mark hopes to
[22.60s -> 27.64s]  free the route in as many days as it takes and accomplish his lifelong goal of free-climbing
[27.64s -> 29.28s]  El Capitan.
[29.28s -> 34.68s]  Follow their story in Free As Can Be, a short climbing film brought to you by Arcteryx.
[34.68s -> 39.32s]  I watched the film over the summer, it's 31 minutes long, it's so well done, it's a story
[39.32s -> 44.56s]  of climbing partnership and adventure, and if you love this podcast, especially if you
[44.56s -> 49.64s]  love the episodes from Yosemite Climbers and stories from the side of El Cap, then
[49.64s -> 51.64s]  I know you'll love the film.

[79.20s -> 81.48s]  This episode is also brought to you by Fizzy Vantage.
[81.48s -> 88.48s]  I have been taking the Fizzy Vantage Supercharged Collagen every day for months, probably close
[88.48s -> 93.40s]  to a year now, and I love knowing that my tendons and my ligaments, the soft tissues
[93.40s -> 98.00s]  in my fingers are getting all the building blocks they need to get stronger.
[98.00s -> 102.84s]  Supercharged Collagen is a research-based athlete-proven supplement that supports collagen
[102.84s -> 108.16s]  synthesis in connective tissues and the force transfer matrix of muscle.
[108.16s -> 109.32s]  What the hell does all that mean?
[109.72s -> 113.96s]  To me, it means that if you want stronger fingers, you should be supplementing with
[113.96s -> 114.96s]  collagen.
[114.96s -> 119.08s]  I personally take some collagen in the morning with my breakfast, and then I take a scoop
[119.08s -> 123.56s]  of it an hour before my finger training, if I'm doing some heavy finger training that
[123.56s -> 128.84s]  day, or if I'm climbing on the moon board or something really high-intensity on my fingers.
[128.84s -> 134.72s]  I still have a long way to go in my own finger strength journey, but it's coming along,
[134.72s -> 137.68s]  and I definitely think the extra collagen is helping.
[137.68s -> 142.56s]  If you would like to feel the Fizzy Vantage, head over to FizzyVantage.com and use code

[225.06s -> 226.50s]  Hello friends.
[226.50s -> 230.70s]  Welcome to another episode of the Nugget Climbing Podcast.
[230.70s -> 235.54s]  This is your host, Stephen Dimmitt, and my guest today is Aiden Roberts.
[235.54s -> 238.46s]  Aiden is a 23-year-old from the UK.
[238.46s -> 243.38s]  I believe he's 23, might be 24, depending on when his birthday is.
[243.38s -> 248.80s]  I first learned about Aiden a few years ago when he came to Colorado and had an absolutely
[248.80s -> 250.94s]  incredible trip.
[250.94s -> 255.22s]  He showed up in Rocky Mountain National Park and put down a bunch of boulders, V12 and
[255.22s -> 258.18s]  harder, really quickly and really made an impression.
[258.18s -> 260.46s]  That's when he first came on my radar.
[260.46s -> 265.30s]  And in the last couple of years, Aiden has established himself as one of the strongest
[265.30s -> 267.90s]  boulders in the world.
[267.90s -> 270.22s]  And I was really excited to talk to him.
[270.22s -> 271.62s]  Aiden's a really thoughtful guy.
[271.62s -> 272.74s]  He's a really sweet guy.
[273.10s -> 277.06s]  He's really easy to talk to and super friendly.
[277.06s -> 282.66s]  And he gives a lot of attention to his climbing and thinks a lot about how he climbs.
[282.66s -> 286.28s]  That was the thing that stood out to me most from this interview.
[286.28s -> 292.42s]  We covered many, many topics, including his training and preparation for the trip that
[292.42s -> 294.98s]  he is currently on in Switzerland.
[294.98s -> 301.02s]  We recorded this almost a month ago on October 5th, about a week before Aiden left on a trip
[301.26s -> 307.98s]  for Switzerland to try a boulder called Alfvén, a V17 put up by Sean Raboutou.
[307.98s -> 313.86s]  And spoiler alert, in case you haven't seen the news, Aiden sent the boulder about a week
[313.86s -> 320.18s]  into his trip and became the first person to repeat an established V17 and only the
[320.18s -> 325.06s]  fourth person in the world to climb V17.
[325.06s -> 327.42s]  So congratulations to Aiden.
[327.42s -> 328.86s]  Absolutely amazing.
[328.86s -> 333.50s]  And again, just so that this is really clear to everybody listening, we recorded this before
[333.50s -> 339.26s]  he left on his trip, but we did talk a lot about his preparation and his training for
[339.26s -> 340.26s]  Alfvén.
[340.26s -> 346.02s]  He was in the final stages of getting ready to leave for his trip to try the boulder.
[346.02s -> 351.10s]  So we talked a lot about that and we covered a lot of other topics in this conversation.
[351.10s -> 352.10s]  I loved it.
[352.10s -> 353.10s]  I'll leave it at that.
[353.10s -> 355.66s]  I'll let you guys discover the rest.
[355.66s -> 362.66s]  Please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with V17 climber Aiden Roberts.
[374.66s -> 375.66s]  Hey.
[375.66s -> 376.66s]  Hey.
[376.66s -> 377.66s]  How are you doing?
[377.66s -> 378.66s]  Good.
[378.66s -> 379.66s]  How are you?
[379.66s -> 380.66s]  Yeah, yeah.
[380.66s -> 381.66s]  Not bad.
[381.66s -> 382.66s]  Oh, nice to see you, man.
[382.66s -> 383.66s]  Oh, thanks, man.
[383.66s -> 384.66s]  Yeah.
[384.66s -> 386.38s]  Oh, that's the pavilion at the Rock Ranch.
[386.38s -> 387.38s]  That's right.
[387.38s -> 388.38s]  Yeah.
[388.38s -> 389.74s]  You want the two-second tour?
[389.74s -> 390.74s]  This is pretty much it.
[390.74s -> 391.74s]  Yeah.
[391.74s -> 392.74s]  Yeah.
[392.74s -> 393.74s]  Go on.
[393.74s -> 394.74s]  Oh, it's nice in there.
[394.74s -> 395.74s]  Thank you.
[395.74s -> 396.74s]  I like it.
[396.74s -> 401.18s]  Oh, it's kind of the dream, huh, working on the road from your van?
[401.18s -> 402.18s]  It is the dream.
[402.18s -> 403.18s]  Yeah.
[403.18s -> 409.34s]  I mean, every day that I have the thoughtfulness to stop and reflect, of course, we take everything
[409.34s -> 411.50s]  for granted sometimes, but I'm super grateful for it.
[411.50s -> 412.50s]  I love it so much.
[412.50s -> 413.50s]  Oh, yeah.
[413.50s -> 414.50s]  Oh, good on you.
[415.34s -> 416.34s]  Yeah, I know.
[416.34s -> 417.34s]  It's neat.
[417.34s -> 418.34s]  Are you still sport climbing?
[418.34s -> 419.34s]  Yes.
[419.34s -> 424.34s]  You were doing some vert limestone when I last seen you.
[424.34s -> 425.34s]  Yeah.
[425.34s -> 426.34s]  Exactly.
[426.34s -> 427.34s]  Yeah.
[427.34s -> 431.74s]  Vertical to slightly overhanging, pocketed and crimpy limestone in Tensleep, Wyoming.
[431.74s -> 434.06s]  And we're here for about 10 more days.
[434.06s -> 440.50s]  So probably I think we have like six or seven more climbing days, hopefully.
[440.50s -> 441.50s]  Weather looks great.
[442.30s -> 447.54s]  I'm hoping to take down my, I've got like a 13D8B project I've been trying and then
[447.54s -> 451.46s]  I'm trying to do some 512s and some other stuff.
[451.46s -> 452.46s]  So we'll see.
[452.46s -> 453.46s]  Fingers crossed.
[453.46s -> 454.46s]  I'm going to go try it today.
[454.46s -> 455.46s]  Yeah.
[455.46s -> 456.70s]  Are you getting the weather for it now?
[456.70s -> 459.58s]  Because it was quite warm when you last spoke to you.
[459.58s -> 460.58s]  Yeah.
[460.58s -> 461.58s]  It's perfect now.
[461.58s -> 466.34s]  But it's funny because Tensleep used to always be like the summer spot, you know, like everyone
[466.34s -> 469.46s]  would come here in July and August and they still do.
[469.46s -> 473.38s]  And August used to be like scent temps and wearing puffies to belay.
[473.38s -> 474.38s]  And now it's October.
[474.38s -> 476.30s]  It's like the new season.
[476.30s -> 477.30s]  It's crazy.
[477.30s -> 478.30s]  Yeah.
[478.30s -> 479.30s]  Yeah.
[479.30s -> 480.30s]  Changing the times of the year.
[480.30s -> 481.30s]  Yeah.
[481.30s -> 485.78s]  It's a bit, the seasons are shifting a little bit.
[485.78s -> 487.34s]  How are you?
[487.34s -> 488.34s]  Yeah.
[488.34s -> 489.34s]  No.
[489.34s -> 490.34s]  Good.
[490.34s -> 491.34s]  Yeah.
[491.34s -> 492.34s]  I'm doing well, actually.
[492.34s -> 493.34s]  Yeah.
[493.34s -> 494.34s]  Seasons change here in the lakes as well.
[495.10s -> 502.42s]  some classic autumnal lakes weather, which is often very wet.
[502.42s -> 505.18s]  Not so cold yet, but a lot of rain.
[505.18s -> 506.18s]  Oh, great.
[506.18s -> 507.42s]  Still warm and rainy.
[507.42s -> 512.94s]  That's not ideal for bouldering, especially on the type of stuff you'd like to do.
[512.94s -> 513.94s]  Yeah.
[513.94s -> 514.94s]  Yeah.
[514.94s -> 515.94s]  It's definitely cooled down a bit.
[515.94s -> 520.02s]  But yeah, now we're on the verge of micro flooding.
[520.02s -> 522.22s]  Oh, really?
[522.22s -> 523.22s]  It's quite.
[523.30s -> 526.98s]  We get a lot of rain in the lakes anyway.
[526.98s -> 527.98s]  When autumn's good, it's amazing.
[527.98s -> 529.62s]  We've had a couple of nice days.
[529.62s -> 530.62s]  Yeah.
[530.62s -> 534.86s]  I always make the most of those, but yeah, no, it's, I've been going well.
[534.86s -> 537.58s]  I'm off to Switzerland next week, actually.
[537.58s -> 538.58s]  So yeah.
[538.58s -> 539.58s]  I've been preparing for that.
[539.58s -> 540.58s]  Yeah.
[540.58s -> 541.58s]  It's been really fun.
[541.58s -> 542.58s]  Awesome.
[542.58s -> 543.58s]  Yeah.
[543.58s -> 544.58s]  I'm excited to dig into that later in the conversation.
[544.58s -> 545.58s]  I'm curious.
[545.58s -> 549.30s]  Are you, are you mixing in outdoor days when you can, or are you just like head down in
[549.30s -> 552.10s]  training mode for this upcoming trip?
[553.10s -> 558.26s]  This upcoming trip has been slightly complicated.
[558.26s -> 566.46s]  I was on a really good trajectory and then had like a little athlete meet one weekend.
[566.46s -> 571.22s]  I don't usually see so many people when I'm in my routine in the lakes, but I knew I had
[571.22s -> 578.30s]  one sociable weekend and an athlete meet and picked up some COVID, which was my first round
[578.30s -> 579.30s]  of it.
[579.30s -> 581.58s]  And that stopped play a little bit.
[582.06s -> 586.26s]  So I had a couple of weeks off, but it was quite good for my, I had a little injury
[586.26s -> 592.30s]  as we having an area, which is now pretty much nipped in the bud, but yeah, no, now
[592.30s -> 594.14s]  I'm in like my latter stages.
[594.14s -> 602.94s]  I'm actually mostly inside, but the reason for that is I've got like a replica of Alfvén,
[602.94s -> 605.90s]  which is the thing I'm mostly going to try.
[605.90s -> 609.34s]  And I set that up on my board a few weeks ago.
[609.34s -> 612.98s]  And it's funny on the actual climb, I had a similar progression as well.
[612.98s -> 617.86s]  Like the first session, I think I did all the moves in the first session I tried on
[617.86s -> 622.30s]  it, but like, they were like the living end on that session.
[622.30s -> 626.74s]  And it was like the next session, like I can maybe link a couple of moves together and
[626.74s -> 631.78s]  every session, it just like very linearly improved and I'd like make bigger and bigger
[631.78s -> 635.82s]  links every session until I felt pretty close.
[635.82s -> 637.06s]  And it was funny.
[637.06s -> 643.78s]  I was like, kind of not in the, I'd had like my finger injury, so I wasn't moving very
[643.78s -> 646.06s]  well on my board.
[646.06s -> 649.86s]  And I kind of like was rehabbing that at the same time, as well as trying to like train
[649.86s -> 651.34s]  specifically for this thing.
[651.34s -> 658.42s]  So it was a bit like juggling, a bit of a balancing act between pushing it and staying
[658.42s -> 660.18s]  reserved enough to recover.
[660.18s -> 668.02s]  But anyway, after a bit of like forced rest and properly rehabbing it, well, I had like
[668.02s -> 673.66s]  a similar situation, like it went from like, just about doing the moves to making good
[673.66s -> 674.66s]  links.
[674.66s -> 679.26s]  So it's quite hopefully, I was quite detailed about that.
[679.26s -> 684.46s]  Maybe I think there's definitely differences between the replica and the climb in that
[684.46s -> 689.46s]  I think that the actual climb is much steeper, but the holds are probably a bit better.
[689.74s -> 692.14s]  Yeah, because it's steep, the holds have to be more positive.
[692.14s -> 696.94s]  My board's 50 and I think the actual thing is probably, I'm not sure quite how steep
[696.94s -> 701.02s]  it is, but maybe like 65, it's pretty steep.
[701.02s -> 707.78s]  So it's not exactly the same, but I made sure like when I was actually on the climb,
[707.78s -> 713.18s]  usually the way I approach a climb, it's like, I'll have, I'll rehearse it in isolation and
[713.18s -> 719.90s]  end up with like a few like bullet points, which like, I can like simplify all the tricks
[719.90s -> 725.42s]  I've learned into like small like points for each move, then that's like my way of like
[725.42s -> 726.74s]  learning a move.
[726.74s -> 729.82s]  And so if I make sure that like the things that would usually fail or like the little
[729.82s -> 735.66s]  bullet points I have to remember for each move, if I make sure that those limiting factors,
[735.66s -> 741.42s]  when I fall off a move, are targeted for each move that I set a replica of, then that's
[741.46s -> 744.26s]  like, that's like kind of like a win for me.
[744.26s -> 747.38s]  It feels like I'm hitting the right stimulus.
[747.38s -> 749.94s]  So I had to play around a bit setting that up.
[749.94s -> 754.30s]  But because I've got that, it now means that that's the most specific thing for me to train
[754.30s -> 755.30s]  on really.
[755.30s -> 759.02s]  So I've just been mostly using that for the last couple of weeks.
[759.02s -> 760.02s]  Okay.
[760.02s -> 762.18s]  Oh man, Aiden, I'm so excited about this.
[762.18s -> 763.18s]  Yeah.
[763.18s -> 766.34s]  Let's, I'm already, yeah, that's already so interesting.
[766.34s -> 769.86s]  I'm so excited to hear more about those bullet points, how you think about that, trying a
[769.86s -> 774.18s]  project and how you simplify things down so you can focus on them in your training.
[774.18s -> 777.46s]  And yeah, I don't know, I've got so many bullet points on my outline.
[777.46s -> 779.18s]  I'm really excited for this conversation.
[779.18s -> 785.86s]  And I had a question for you before we dive into just the conversation and letting it roll.
[785.86s -> 788.82s]  I'm already recording and we just rolled right in as I knew we would, because you're
[788.82s -> 792.82s]  so easy to talk to, but people are very, very interested in you.
[792.82s -> 796.50s]  I like to, so I have Patreon.
[796.50s -> 799.30s]  I have a bunch of patrons who support the podcast.
[799.74s -> 803.82s]  And I always, whenever I remember to, and when it's not a super last minute conversation,
[803.82s -> 808.42s]  I reach out to my patrons and say, here's who's coming up, here's a little bit of information
[808.42s -> 810.38s]  about this person.
[810.38s -> 811.98s]  Let me know if you have questions for them.
[811.98s -> 816.86s]  And I either consider that in the way I shape my own outline, or I just ask their questions
[816.86s -> 818.58s]  outright.
[818.58s -> 822.90s]  And I don't think I've ever gotten this many questions for somebody, ever, not even close.
[822.90s -> 828.22s]  I got like two dozen questions for you, an overwhelming number of questions.
[828.22s -> 835.06s]  People are very interested in this guy from the UK, Aiden Roberts, and in his amazing
[835.06s -> 836.50s]  crimp strength.
[836.50s -> 842.62s]  And I wonder if we could do this the way that I did an interview with Ron Kauk, where I
[842.62s -> 844.18s]  just stick to the outline.
[844.18s -> 846.18s]  We just have whatever conversation we have.
[846.18s -> 850.38s]  And then maybe you and I can do a follow up where we just do like a listener Q&A and just
[850.38s -> 851.38s]  tackle a bunch of them.
[851.38s -> 852.38s]  Does that sound good to you?
[852.38s -> 853.38s]  Yeah.
[853.38s -> 854.38s]  Yeah.
[854.38s -> 855.38s]  No, that works well for me.
[855.38s -> 856.38s]  I'm almost quite surprised by that.
[856.38s -> 866.86s]  I guess like, maybe I'm especially secretive and I feel like on the scale of climbers you
[866.86s -> 873.02s]  talk to, I'm probably pretty, I feel like I'm probably quite small, small fish in terms
[873.02s -> 876.10s]  of like influence over the climbing community.
[876.10s -> 877.10s]  I don't know.
[877.10s -> 881.30s]  I mean, it is that perfect balance maybe where you're, you're climbing at like an absolute
[881.30s -> 884.90s]  top of the world, sort of world class level.
[884.90s -> 887.78s]  And also there's not that much information about you.
[887.78s -> 889.22s]  So people are fascinated, I think.
[889.22s -> 892.06s]  And you've also, you know, we've teased you in other conversations.
[892.06s -> 896.02s]  Like I talked to Dan Varian and we talked about you a little bit and I talked to Tom
[896.02s -> 898.66s]  Herbert and we talked kind of about you a little bit.
[898.66s -> 902.38s]  So you've just, you know, you've, you've, without even meaning to, you've kind of created
[902.38s -> 904.22s]  this allure, I think.
[904.22s -> 906.12s]  But okay, perfect.
[906.12s -> 909.86s]  So we're five minutes into an interview and we've already got the next one booked.
[909.86s -> 910.86s]  So that's great.
[910.86s -> 911.86s]  Sweet.
[911.86s -> 912.86s]  Yeah.
[912.86s -> 913.86s]  Yeah.
[913.86s -> 914.86s]  Yeah.
[915.82s -> 916.82s]  Yeah.
[916.82s -> 917.82s]  It took me to not, to not botch this one.
[917.82s -> 918.82s]  So you actually want to come back?
[918.82s -> 919.82s]  No, no.
[919.82s -> 920.82s]  I'm all game.
[920.82s -> 923.22s]  I'm looking forward to all those questions.
[923.22s -> 924.22s]  Nice.
[924.22s -> 928.50s]  Well, I'll give a little context about Alfvén since you already mentioned that.
[928.50s -> 933.62s]  I actually watched the film Alfvén this morning.
[933.62s -> 935.86s]  I hadn't gotten around to watching it yet.
[935.86s -> 941.90s]  And the film Alfvén, it's a group of guys in Switzerland, bouldering.
[941.90s -> 945.98s]  And the name of the film is named after a specific boulder problem that's the feature
[945.98s -> 946.98s]  of the film.
[946.98s -> 954.14s]  Sean Raboteau does the first ascent of this V17 called Alfvén, this amazing looking long,
[954.14s -> 955.14s]  is it granite?
[955.14s -> 956.14s]  It looks like granite to me.
[956.14s -> 957.14s]  Yeah.
[957.14s -> 958.14s]  Yeah.
[958.14s -> 959.14s]  Yeah.
[959.14s -> 960.14s]  Most of that Tichina Ravi is granite.
[960.14s -> 961.14s]  Yeah.
[961.14s -> 962.90s]  It just, it's just like absolutely stunning.
[962.90s -> 968.62s]  And it's this super long, Sean breaks it down as either like V15 into a V16 without a rest
[968.62s -> 970.22s]  or V14 into a 15.
[970.22s -> 975.54s]  He's not really sure, but certainly one of the hardest boulder problems in the world.
[975.54s -> 978.70s]  Top three for sure that's been done, maybe even the hardest.
[978.70s -> 984.10s]  So you were in that video, you were featured and I kept catching little snippets of you,
[984.10s -> 985.10s]  which was fun.
[985.10s -> 988.84s]  And you and I talked a week ago and we talked about your training for that boulder.
[988.84s -> 993.76s]  So I would love to dive into more of that in a second, but it was really funny.
[993.76s -> 996.42s]  So that's about a 45 minute feature film.
[996.42s -> 997.42s]  It's amazing.
[997.42s -> 998.42s]  It's beautiful.
[998.42s -> 999.42s]  It's really well edited.
[999.62s -> 1000.78s]  It's really fun to watch.
[1000.78s -> 1005.90s]  It's got some hard music behind it, like it's got hip hop and rap and I just was like watching
[1005.90s -> 1010.10s]  it just like foaming at the mouth, you know, just like, yes, I want to go bouldering.
[1010.10s -> 1012.58s]  And I finished that.
[1012.58s -> 1018.42s]  And I think the first time I was introduced to you, a friend told me about your trip to
[1018.42s -> 1023.54s]  Rocky Mountain National Park back in like 2018 or 19.
[1023.54s -> 1024.54s]  Yeah, 2019.
[1024.54s -> 1025.54s]  19.
[1025.54s -> 1026.54s]  Okay.
[1026.66s -> 1029.78s]  So there's this little film that came out, it's like six minutes long, that came out
[1029.78s -> 1031.82s]  on the Mellow Climbing channel.
[1031.82s -> 1036.50s]  That's where the Alfvén film is as well, called Aiden Roberts Crushing in Colorado.
[1036.50s -> 1039.18s]  And I'd watched that a few years ago before I started the podcast.
[1039.18s -> 1043.34s]  And I just rewatched that this morning as well after Alfvén and it was the juxtaposition
[1043.34s -> 1048.34s]  of those two films was really funny because, you know, it's these dudes crushing in Switzerland
[1048.34s -> 1051.22s]  and to hip hop and rap and stuff.
[1051.22s -> 1056.42s]  And then it's the six minute film of Aiden Roberts, like just absolutely smashing a
[1056.42s -> 1060.62s]  bunch of boulders like V12 and harder to Elton John's Rocket Man.
[1060.62s -> 1066.06s]  And just like the vibe of the film was so different and so cool.
[1066.06s -> 1070.94s]  Did you choose that song for that film and if so, why that one that was really interesting
[1070.94s -> 1071.94s]  to me?
[1071.94s -> 1073.78s]  No, that wasn't me that chose that.
[1073.78s -> 1081.18s]  So I just, that trip was the first time I met all the people behind Mellow.
[1081.18s -> 1087.58s]  I'd met like the year before, 2018, I'd been to Colorado as well, but just for the World
[1087.58s -> 1090.46s]  Cup, I barely climbed outside that trip.
[1090.46s -> 1095.06s]  And I met Keenan Takahashi when I was out there.
[1095.06s -> 1097.70s]  And so kept in touch with him.
[1097.70s -> 1100.94s]  And yeah, I really like him, he's a super nice guy.
[1100.94s -> 1107.62s]  So the next year I went back and kind of planned a bit of a longer trip and he introduced
[1107.62s -> 1112.90s]  me to a lot of like, I went out climbing with Daniel for the first time at the start of
[1112.90s -> 1118.66s]  that trip and then got to know like Sean and Giuliano, Giuliano I was visiting at the same
[1118.66s -> 1119.66s]  time.
[1119.66s -> 1121.02s]  So I got to know them then.
[1121.02s -> 1126.98s]  And so I just sent the footage to Giuliano, he said, I'll do a little edit for Mellow.
[1126.98s -> 1130.90s]  And yeah, I chose Rocket Man, it was nice.
[1131.86s -> 1139.14s]  It kind of maybe does capture it a bit, my climbing experience a bit better than the
[1139.14s -> 1140.66s]  hip hop and rap.
[1140.66s -> 1145.74s]  I can get motivated and psyched, I guess, watching stuff like that.
[1145.74s -> 1150.02s]  I really enjoyed the Alfvén film and that kind of style where it gets you like your
[1150.02s -> 1151.98s]  fingertips sweaty just watching it.
[1151.98s -> 1154.14s]  I really enjoy that.
[1154.14s -> 1159.82s]  But the state that I usually have to find for me to climb is a lot less like, I never
[1159.82s -> 1162.42s]  get myself hyped up or anything.
[1162.42s -> 1168.70s]  I find my level of focus through relaxation or like a lot of calm.
[1168.70s -> 1176.14s]  I feel like, yeah, I find after I calm myself down, I kind of relax to focus to climb hard
[1176.14s -> 1179.54s]  as opposed to getting myself all fired up.
[1179.54s -> 1182.02s]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[1182.02s -> 1184.26s]  I enjoy it from the sidelines.
[1184.26s -> 1185.26s]  Nice.
[1185.26s -> 1186.26s]  That makes me curious.
[1186.26s -> 1189.26s]  What do you do?
[1189.26s -> 1192.78s]  One boulder that stood out from that film, I mean, for people listening, it's a six-minute
[1192.78s -> 1197.46s]  film of just like send back to back to back to back, just like hard send after hard send
[1197.46s -> 1200.62s]  of Aiden just climbing these classics in Rocky Mountain.
[1200.62s -> 1203.50s]  I think everything in the film is V12 or harder.
[1203.50s -> 1206.62s]  But the one that really stood out to me was Jade, just because that's a really well-known
[1206.62s -> 1212.30s]  boulder problem, V14 up in Upper Chaos on the Green 45 boulder.
[1212.30s -> 1217.66s]  And watching you do that, I was like, yes, this is such a perfect example of what sets
[1217.66s -> 1218.66s]  this guy apart.
[1219.06s -> 1223.62s]  I think it's this 45-degree overhang on these tiny little messed up cramps.
[1223.62s -> 1224.66s]  I've felt the holds.
[1224.66s -> 1227.86s]  I've gone up and tried the stand start a little bit.
[1227.86s -> 1231.18s]  And you just make it look like a V5.
[1231.18s -> 1235.66s]  It just looks so in your wheelhouse and so controlled.
[1235.66s -> 1240.90s]  You're so good at just locking in on tiny little holds like that on that style.
[1240.90s -> 1244.58s]  And you're absolutely one of the best in the world at that sort of thing.
[1244.58s -> 1248.10s]  And so, I mean, that's going to be at the heart of a lot of what we talk about today,
[1248.10s -> 1249.54s]  like how you've gotten so good at that.
[1249.54s -> 1253.86s]  And I'm also so interested with you in a conversation that we had a week ago.
[1253.86s -> 1255.78s]  We talked a lot about climbing style.
[1255.78s -> 1262.30s]  And you really seem to have reflected on and embraced your own climbing style and doubled
[1262.30s -> 1266.98s]  and tripled down on becoming one of the best at that versus what you could have done,
[1266.98s -> 1272.10s]  which is, okay, I'm going to become a perfectly well-rounded climber and always be attacking
[1272.10s -> 1274.54s]  my weaknesses and trying to be able to do everything.
[1274.54s -> 1280.74s]  And it seems like you've really chosen to just go all in on that kind of crimpy, locked
[1280.74s -> 1283.62s]  in sort of board style of climbing.
[1283.62s -> 1286.90s]  And that shows in a lot of the hardest rock climbs you've done.
[1286.90s -> 1287.90s]  I feel like I'm rambling.
[1287.90s -> 1288.90s]  I'm all over the place.
[1288.90s -> 1289.90s]  But...
[1289.90s -> 1290.90s]  No, no.
[1290.90s -> 1291.90s]  In terms of...
[1291.90s -> 1292.90s]  Yeah.
[1292.90s -> 1298.46s]  I think at that point, I was kind of at the transition phase of, like, I'd been doing
[1298.46s -> 1303.54s]  a lot of comps and I was kind of transitioning to mostly just focusing on outdoor climbing
[1303.54s -> 1306.42s]  during that trip in Colorado.
[1306.42s -> 1308.98s]  I hadn't completely decided on it at that point.
[1308.98s -> 1309.98s]  It took me a long time.
[1309.98s -> 1313.66s]  But it took me a couple of years to phase out.
[1313.66s -> 1316.46s]  You hadn't decided on leaving competitions?
[1316.46s -> 1317.46s]  What do you mean?
[1317.46s -> 1318.46s]  Yeah.
[1318.46s -> 1319.46s]  So I...
[1319.46s -> 1325.90s]  2018, I was pretty much just like, that was my first year as a senior competitor.
[1325.90s -> 1326.90s]  I'd done all the...
[1326.90s -> 1331.74s]  I'd pretty much focused on youth comps in the early years of my climbing.
[1331.94s -> 1334.90s]  2018, I transitioned to the senior comps.
[1334.90s -> 1338.66s]  Pretty much focused on just on the competitions.
[1338.66s -> 1345.02s]  And then I was a bit disappointed by it, or not disappointed by it.
[1345.02s -> 1348.94s]  I felt dissatisfied with how I'd climbed in the competitions.
[1348.94s -> 1353.06s]  I also feel like the actual feeling of doing the competitions wasn't quite as fulfilling
[1353.06s -> 1357.86s]  as maybe I'd expected it would be.
[1357.86s -> 1361.58s]  And at the end of that season, well, near the tail end of that season, I took a really
[1362.42s -> 1366.02s]  long trip to Rocklands, which was my first time going.
[1366.02s -> 1371.34s]  It was like, I'd never really done just a long trip abroad, bouldering before.
[1371.34s -> 1375.54s]  And I think I'd done a lot of training over the previous few years.
[1375.54s -> 1385.94s]  And it was in quite classic UK style, which the origins of board climbing often originated
[1385.94s -> 1388.26s]  around the UK.
[1388.74s -> 1391.94s]  I've always been like a real advocate for training on a board.
[1391.94s -> 1398.66s]  And so my training really hard was usually reflected by, or like me on good form was reflected
[1398.66s -> 1403.70s]  by how well I was climbing on a board, which in hindsight, maybe I should have thought
[1403.70s -> 1404.70s]  about it a bit more.
[1404.70s -> 1411.06s]  It doesn't translate that well to competitions, but I'd done a lot of training for the competitions.
[1411.06s -> 1416.46s]  A lot of it had been that, and as a result, I was on pretty good form on a board, which
[1416.46s -> 1419.34s]  actually translates way better to climbing outside.
[1419.34s -> 1427.58s]  So I went to Rocklands and I kind of knew that I've always liked functioning.
[1427.58s -> 1435.18s]  I've always liked being in the outdoors and I really like how climbing outside can really
[1435.18s -> 1440.54s]  immerse us in nature and is a real nice point of contact with the natural world.
[1440.54s -> 1446.14s]  And I kind of had a stark contrast of dipping about between all these competitions to being
[1446.46s -> 1447.46s]  in one place.
[1447.46s -> 1452.86s]  I think I went for five and a half weeks or six weeks or something and just really immerse
[1452.86s -> 1458.34s]  myself in that world, which is very different to any scenery I've been in before.
[1458.34s -> 1465.98s]  So it was really cool to be just outside every day in somewhere very novel and really get
[1465.98s -> 1468.94s]  to know a place.
[1468.94s -> 1475.50s]  Every climbing day I had, I had so much fun and glimpses of euphoric moments that you
[1475.58s -> 1478.38s]  can have in competitions, which were very rare.
[1478.38s -> 1481.58s]  But there's like an addictive nature to it.
[1481.58s -> 1485.10s]  You're like, oh, the next one could be it kind of thing, kind of kept me in the game
[1485.10s -> 1486.86s]  for a little while.
[1486.86s -> 1490.22s]  I realized it wasn't quite so oscillating.
[1490.22s -> 1495.50s]  I was disappointed for most of my competition experiences, but when I was outside, I'd kind
[1495.50s -> 1501.54s]  of have like, it would dip between like a little spike of like a euphoric moment doing a climb.
[1501.58s -> 1506.86s]  And then the base level was just like very happy and very content as opposed to like
[1506.86s -> 1510.98s]  you bomb in a competition and just like, oh, what is this?
[1510.98s -> 1516.50s]  Like I've spent loads of money, I've traveled all this way just to like be disappointed
[1516.50s -> 1518.54s]  in a bit.
[1518.54s -> 1524.62s]  So like, it was like, I was a lot more stable and like, I kind of felt like the every day
[1524.62s -> 1526.10s]  I enjoyed way more.
[1526.10s -> 1532.46s]  And like, I actually found just the experience of like climbing outside so much more valuable
[1532.46s -> 1533.46s]  for me.
[1533.46s -> 1538.42s]  So I kind of knew that I was in that like transition phase, but I was still kind of
[1538.42s -> 1539.42s]  wrestling with it.
[1539.42s -> 1542.58s]  It was quite hard to fully step away from comps.
[1542.58s -> 1549.14s]  I kind of had seen myself as a comp climber for a long time, but it was, I was quite fortunate.
[1549.14s -> 1553.82s]  Like I was presented a positive alternative of this rock climbing, which I was probably
[1553.82s -> 1555.70s]  quite a lot better at.
[1556.30s -> 1559.50s]  So I understand it kind of made my decision quite easy in that sense, but it still took
[1559.50s -> 1560.50s]  me a while.
[1560.50s -> 1566.86s]  But yeah, when for all of those years, I was trying to juggle up like on the discussion
[1566.86s -> 1567.86s]  of style.
[1567.86s -> 1571.62s]  You said you were rambling, I'm really rambling.
[1571.62s -> 1576.62s]  On the discussion of style, I think throughout all that time being a comp climber, you kind
[1576.62s -> 1582.66s]  of wrestling, trying to like juggle up all the skills and like naturally the way I like
[1582.66s -> 1587.86s]  to train or the training that I enjoyed most was like you say, like isolating on small
[1587.86s -> 1590.66s]  holds and moving quite statically between them.
[1590.66s -> 1591.66s]  And that was the thing I was good at.
[1591.66s -> 1596.22s]  And I think I was probably good at it in the first place because in the early days of my
[1596.22s -> 1597.22s]  climbing, I enjoyed it.
[1597.22s -> 1602.38s]  Well, like I got a lot of satisfaction of that control I had on the wall.
[1602.38s -> 1604.42s]  So that was like the way I naturally climbed.
[1604.42s -> 1608.34s]  And I think I was wrestling with that throughout all of competitions being like, this isn't
[1608.34s -> 1609.82s]  very helpful.
[1609.82s -> 1616.10s]  So I'll try and like get good at smashing around on slopey volumes and pinches and doing
[1616.10s -> 1619.30s]  one, two, three triple dynos or whatever.
[1619.30s -> 1623.22s]  And I think I'd started leaning into it a lot more.
[1623.22s -> 1627.66s]  And since I've gone out, started solely climbing outside or focusing much more on climbing
[1627.66s -> 1633.84s]  outside, I've probably leaned into the style, which I feel is most helpful for me, helpful
[1633.84s -> 1639.12s]  for me to climb outside and, uh, let the other things fall away.
[1639.12s -> 1645.80s]  Not necessarily like, yeah, I guess it comes to like the phrase of like working your weaknesses,
[1645.80s -> 1651.28s]  which like I do, if I have glaringly weak, I do like work things that I'm not good at,
[1651.28s -> 1658.52s]  but only if they impede me or like, uh, I'm not gonna, well, I haven't in the past few
[1658.52s -> 1662.40s]  years gone to the wall and train doing a load of dynos.
[1662.40s -> 1667.16s]  I don't really even train slabs that much because I don't usually do that many of them
[1667.16s -> 1668.16s]  outside.
[1668.16s -> 1674.80s]  Um, I will train my weaknesses when they are limitations to me, but I won't go out
[1674.80s -> 1679.08s]  my way to train my weaknesses to be an all rounded climber because it's not really what
[1679.08s -> 1682.28s]  I'm looking, looking to get out of it.
[1682.28s -> 1683.28s]  Yeah.
[1683.28s -> 1687.48s]  I want to just dive really deeply into this because you and I had a conversation that
[1687.48s -> 1688.80s]  was so interesting to me.
[1688.80s -> 1692.80s]  We talked about a week ago, just got to know each other a little bit and, uh, you were
[1692.80s -> 1698.92s]  telling me about your trip this past spring to Switzerland, uh, this March and April.
[1698.92s -> 1703.12s]  This is when you were out there with what I call the mellow crew, you know, it's Sean
[1703.12s -> 1708.80s]  Raboutou and Daniel Woods, Matty Hong, Dave Graham, uh, Giuliano Cameroni, Felipe Carmago
[1708.80s -> 1714.00s]  and more people, um, who were featured in this film, Al Fain and Aidan's out there climbing
[1714.00s -> 1715.96s]  with these guys.
[1715.96s -> 1718.16s]  And, um, you said a really interesting thing.
[1718.52s -> 1722.16s]  I mean, you and I were talking about your climbing style, but you said that you noticed
[1722.16s -> 1726.04s]  you were really like paying attention and watching all these other amazing top level
[1726.04s -> 1727.04s]  climbers.
[1727.04s -> 1734.04s]  I mean, this is a group of most of the strongest climbers in the world, boulders in particular.
[1734.04s -> 1737.28s]  And you said everyone really seemed to have their own niche.
[1737.28s -> 1743.32s]  Like everyone actually had pretty glaring weaknesses, but also amazing strengths.
[1743.32s -> 1747.84s]  And every single one of those guys climbed differently, but had found a way to adapt
[1748.52s -> 1752.76s]  to these really hard boulders and they were all climbing at a really similar level.
[1752.76s -> 1757.00s]  And this is very, very interesting to me because I, like, this is something I've been reflecting
[1757.00s -> 1763.16s]  on a lot for the last few years is, um, realizing that I'm, I kind of romanticize like the
[1763.16s -> 1766.96s]  all rounder climber, like being able to do everything.
[1766.96s -> 1770.88s]  And I've always like really sought out, uh, weaknesses.
[1770.88s -> 1775.60s]  Like when I, whenever I come across a style in climbing that I struggle with, my first
[1775.64s -> 1778.48s]  reaction is like, ah, fuck, I need to do a lot more of that.
[1778.48s -> 1779.48s]  You know, I suck at that.
[1779.48s -> 1782.92s]  So I need to like pivot and do a lot more of it.
[1782.92s -> 1785.48s]  And that can be a really good thing obviously.
[1785.48s -> 1787.64s]  And that has really helped me grow as a climber.
[1787.64s -> 1792.68s]  But in the last couple of years I've been realizing I also have some super power, like
[1792.68s -> 1797.44s]  my own relative superpowers and I kind of don't focus on them as much as I could.
[1797.44s -> 1802.44s]  I think I could get a lot more out of actually focusing on the things that I'm good at and
[1802.44s -> 1808.12s]  paying more attention to, okay, how does my body work best to climb the things that
[1808.12s -> 1813.36s]  I want to climb and what are my strengths and how could I get even more out of my strengths?
[1813.36s -> 1821.52s]  And um, yeah, you just represent someone who's really done an amazing job of that.
[1821.52s -> 1826.44s]  But yeah, first things first in introducing that kind of idea and getting to your own
[1826.44s -> 1830.60s]  climbing style and how you think of your own climbing style, maybe first, can you tell
[1830.60s -> 1836.08s]  me a little bit about what you learned climbing with all those other guys and some of the
[1836.08s -> 1837.92s]  patterns or things that you saw?
[1837.92s -> 1839.40s]  Like I'm putting you on the spot.
[1839.40s -> 1842.80s]  I don't want you to, you know, I don't want to make you feel like you have to judge these
[1842.80s -> 1845.04s]  other climbers because obviously they're all amazing.
[1845.04s -> 1849.80s]  But yeah, what were some of the things that stood out to you from just jumping into this,
[1849.80s -> 1853.92s]  you know, pool of some of the best boulders in the world and climbing on these V16s and
[1853.92s -> 1854.92s]  17s with them?
[1854.92s -> 1858.36s]  Yeah, no, um, no, it was really cool.
[1858.68s -> 1861.36s]  I've got a few things to say about their styles.
[1861.36s -> 1866.60s]  I think like, it was really interesting to work, yeah, just generally climb with them.
[1866.60s -> 1870.40s]  I climbed with them quite a lot on Alfvén, but I climbed with them on other stuff as
[1870.40s -> 1871.40s]  well.
[1871.40s -> 1876.64s]  We went and had a look at other projects we'd found and it was really, yeah, I was really
[1876.64s -> 1884.20s]  surprised to see how like, there was almost like a, there was like a load of the top, yes,
[1884.20s -> 1889.12s]  the best, like you said, they're like pretty much a group of mostly the best boulders in
[1889.12s -> 1892.68s]  the world and they're so different.
[1892.68s -> 1898.00s]  And I kind of knew that about climbing, like there's no magic formula in terms of like,
[1898.00s -> 1903.48s]  I think it's quite easy to trap the fall into, like to be the best, you have to be able to
[1903.48s -> 1911.28s]  hang so much off like an edge or be able to do one armors with 20 kilos on you or something.
[1911.28s -> 1917.24s]  And like all of this, like there is like, there's just no like simple way to actually
[1917.24s -> 1919.92s]  be the best.
[1919.92s -> 1925.24s]  And like, obviously for most people, that's not their intention anyway, but majority of
[1925.24s -> 1927.72s]  climbers are looking to get better.
[1927.72s -> 1935.24s]  And I think it was really interesting to see that these climbers who were like, like the
[1935.24s -> 1940.64s]  mellow crew, it felt to me like they'd really leaned into what they knew they were good
[1940.64s -> 1942.16s]  at.
[1942.16s -> 1948.84s]  And it was really cool to see how, like how stark the changes in how they'd approach climbs
[1948.84s -> 1949.84s]  would be.
[1949.84s -> 1957.20s]  So like, I don't know, Dave Crams being called like a wizard of climbing at times and things.
[1957.20s -> 1961.52s]  And it's kind of like almost like comical, but it was really interesting to see those
[1961.52s -> 1967.76s]  climbs, which like, I'd like work on with him and everyone else would like do a move
[1967.76s -> 1971.68s]  and they'd like, there'd be a sequence and they'd figure out a sequence, which I would
[1971.68s -> 1972.68s]  feel reliable.
[1972.68s -> 1974.04s]  And it'd be like, oh yeah, nice.
[1974.04s -> 1978.32s]  Like that's figured out, we'll like, we've done that for all the sections, we'll go
[1978.32s -> 1979.80s]  from the start.
[1979.80s -> 1988.88s]  And there was actually a climb in that film, Fight Club, which I think in the film, Sean
[1989.08s -> 1991.16s]  and Daniel do in the Alfvén film.
[1991.16s -> 1992.16s]  V14?
[1992.16s -> 1993.16s]  Is that right?
[1993.16s -> 1994.16s]  Yeah.
[1994.16s -> 1995.16s]  Yeah.
[1995.16s -> 1996.16s]  That's the one.
[1996.16s -> 1998.16s]  And it's quite a long climb, but there's like a obvious breakdown where you do the
[1998.16s -> 2002.08s]  hard climbing and you get to like a good jog rest and then you do the, you do like the
[2002.08s -> 2004.64s]  slopey rail out right.
[2004.64s -> 2008.84s]  And like the last move of the hard climbing, like generally most people were doing it a
[2008.84s -> 2009.84s]  pretty similar way.
[2009.84s -> 2014.44s]  You get like a front free crimp and like bringing up a vague toe hook to like stab into like
[2014.44s -> 2016.12s]  a slot.
[2016.12s -> 2021.32s]  And everyone kind of like did that and was like, everyone would do the move, like when
[2021.32s -> 2025.20s]  we were figuring it out and people were kind of like, didn't question it that much.
[2025.20s -> 2027.12s]  Like it was quite obvious how to do the move.
[2027.12s -> 2032.08s]  But anyway, like Dave spent like hours just like figuring out this other way of like,
[2032.08s -> 2034.84s]  kind of like dropping down, adding like a bunch more moves.
[2034.84s -> 2039.00s]  But like, I can't even remember, I don't, I can't recall if he actually did the whole
[2039.00s -> 2044.20s]  climb, but it was really interesting to see that it was like, just doing something wasn't
[2044.20s -> 2045.20s]  like enough.
[2045.28s -> 2050.48s]  Like he had to like ensure there was no better way, more efficient way.
[2050.48s -> 2059.92s]  A good example is I, a better example actually was the system boulder in Fiannay, which Sean
[2059.92s -> 2060.92s]  did as well.
[2060.92s -> 2066.76s]  The first ascent of, and he did it like a really physical, physical way, like very powerful.
[2066.76s -> 2071.48s]  And I was trying climbing there with just Dave much later on.
[2071.48s -> 2077.52s]  And he, again, like was just spending like sessions and sessions, just like really understanding
[2077.52s -> 2079.80s]  every different possibility.
[2079.80s -> 2084.24s]  And he ended up doing that boulder, like a completely different way to short, but like,
[2084.24s -> 2087.80s]  he's like so persevering on understanding the climb.
[2087.80s -> 2089.16s]  And there's a lot to learn from that.
[2089.16s -> 2094.28s]  Like, I mean, like, it's like amazing to see, like people will say it, but like in terms
[2094.28s -> 2099.08s]  of like physically body strong, Dave's like not that impressed.
[2099.08s -> 2104.24s]  Like as in, you put him in, like, if you were to do like some testing and not to look
[2104.24s -> 2110.60s]  at the data of like what most AC plus climbers could do in terms of just like, well, there's
[2110.60s -> 2116.68s]  not many AC plus climbers, but like most AC, like if you were to look at that, he'd like
[2116.68s -> 2122.72s]  come out the bottom of the pile, but like, he's so good at like kind of making like figuring
[2122.72s -> 2124.64s]  out the best way and making it work for him.
[2124.72s -> 2129.88s]  I think like he's incredibly patient and like, that's almost like his superpower.
[2129.88s -> 2135.96s]  Like he's so persevering with things and can like climb things like pretty optimally.
[2135.96s -> 2144.80s]  And then like that is so radically different to like Daniel who is ridiculously strong.
[2144.80s -> 2148.76s]  And I mean the theme between all of them, they were like, I was really impressed with
[2148.76s -> 2151.44s]  how persevering they were.
[2151.44s -> 2156.72s]  Like it's something I've thought sometimes I've never really dipped into like that proper
[2156.72s -> 2165.12s]  like projecting mindset, but like they're so able to commit themselves for prolonged
[2165.12s -> 2171.32s]  spells to like learn and like, or recruit themselves on a climb.
[2171.32s -> 2177.72s]  But I was really amazed by like, yeah, essentially in terms of styles, Sean, it's hard to like
[2177.72s -> 2182.92s]  generalize over all climbs, but if we were to look at Alfvén, the way that myself and
[2182.92s -> 2190.72s]  Sean were trying it were, well, Sean did it obviously, not mean to spoil that video.
[2190.72s -> 2196.32s]  I think people are aware of that, but Sean climbs in a very different way to me.
[2196.32s -> 2202.48s]  So I can go into a bit of the mechanics to it, but basically Sean seems to be like really
[2202.48s -> 2207.88s]  strong in like compressing holds or like seems to be like the front of his body dominant.
[2207.88s -> 2215.32s]  So like in conjunction with that, basically he's really good when his hands are more open.
[2215.32s -> 2220.40s]  So you spoke a lot about, I think this is where I was mentioned in one of the previous
[2220.40s -> 2222.76s]  podcasts you did with Dan Barian.
[2222.76s -> 2230.12s]  We spoke quite a lot about high angle crimping, just trying to think the most, the best way
[2230.12s -> 2231.88s]  to go about explaining this.
[2231.88s -> 2235.36s]  Maybe I'll actually explain the mechanics of how I climb and how that differs to Sean.
[2235.36s -> 2236.96s]  I think it might make a bit more sense.
[2236.96s -> 2237.96s]  Perfect.
[2237.96s -> 2238.96s]  Does that work?
[2238.96s -> 2239.96s]  Yeah.
[2239.96s -> 2240.96s]  Yeah.
[2240.96s -> 2244.96s]  So the high angle crimping, if you haven't listened to that episode, Dan, and you go
[2244.96s -> 2251.64s]  into a lot of detail into it, but essentially, basically what that is, is your fingers are
[2251.64s -> 2254.92s]  like more acutely flexed.
[2254.92s -> 2256.60s]  Is it this PIP joint?
[2256.60s -> 2257.60s]  Yeah.
[2257.60s -> 2258.60s]  It's the PIP.
[2258.60s -> 2259.60s]  Yeah.
[2259.60s -> 2261.32s]  They're more like acutely flexed at the PIP joint.
[2261.32s -> 2266.20s]  And usually the hallmark for it is like your pinky is also flexed at this joint.
[2266.20s -> 2270.68s]  So that's what differs it to like a half crimp, which would usually be defined by like a
[2270.68s -> 2272.16s]  straight pinky.
[2272.16s -> 2273.64s]  So all your fingers.
[2273.64s -> 2274.64s]  Yeah.
[2274.64s -> 2275.64s]  Yeah.
[2275.64s -> 2276.64s]  Can I mention something?
[2276.64s -> 2279.08s]  So Aiden's demonstrating, he's like holding his hands out in front of me.
[2279.08s -> 2283.56s]  So for people that can't see the video, and I want to clarify this because I did get
[2283.56s -> 2285.24s]  quite a few questions about this.
[2285.24s -> 2290.24s]  weren't totally understanding what high angle crimping was, but essentially just put your
[2290.24s -> 2291.92s]  hand in a full crimp position.
[2291.92s -> 2297.04s]  Just imagine that you're doing a full crimp on a full crimp position with your hand on
[2297.04s -> 2299.96s]  a small edge or something.
[2299.96s -> 2305.48s]  Imagine that's a tiny little in-cut edge and your fingers almost have to be pointed downward
[2305.48s -> 2309.92s]  to get into the back of the hold so that you can pull outward on the hold so you have better
[2309.92s -> 2310.92s]  leverage.
[2310.92s -> 2311.92s]  Yeah.
[2312.76s -> 2316.60s]  That's a good way of explaining it.
[2316.60s -> 2322.16s]  And so essentially that like acute flexion of all your fingers, I don't do that because
[2322.16s -> 2325.88s]  that's the position that my fingers can produce the most force in.
[2325.88s -> 2330.36s]  Like if I were to hang on an edge, I wouldn't be able to hang on a crimp like that on a
[2330.36s -> 2332.40s]  fingerboard and be like comfortable.
[2332.40s -> 2335.20s]  My go-to would always be a half crimp.
[2335.20s -> 2340.52s]  So like just like the force I can generate in that position downwards, it's way worse
[2340.64s -> 2346.80s]  than I would in a half crimp, but I nearly exclusively climb in that position.
[2346.80s -> 2353.44s]  And that's kind of like one link in the chain, which works like builds the style I climb
[2353.44s -> 2354.88s]  in mostly.
[2354.88s -> 2358.56s]  Essentially what that really allows you to do is utilize any like in-cut on any holds
[2358.56s -> 2362.44s]  that you use and it allows you to generate force away from the wall.
[2362.44s -> 2368.16s]  So it's like high angle crimping essentially allows you to pull your hand away from the
[2368.16s -> 2369.68s]  wall.
[2369.84s -> 2375.32s]  And to be able to like utilize that mostly, I'm actually pretty weak, the front half
[2375.32s -> 2376.32s]  of my body.
[2376.32s -> 2378.92s]  Well, I think it's relatively weak.
[2378.92s -> 2381.16s]  I'm very, really back dominant.
[2381.16s -> 2386.16s]  So like my shoulders and back will usually end up like I retract my shoulders.
[2386.16s -> 2390.48s]  So like, I'm just trying to think of how to describe this on a podcast.
[2390.48s -> 2396.16s]  If you were to imagine like holding a hold beside you, your arm out at 90 degrees and
[2396.16s -> 2398.40s]  like retract your hand outwards.
[2398.40s -> 2401.04s]  So like your scaps are almost touching together.
[2401.04s -> 2405.92s]  Like that movement uses a lot of your back and your rear delt.
[2405.92s -> 2411.16s]  And so I like use those mostly and that like allows me to like basically generate force
[2411.16s -> 2416.48s]  away from the wall and like bring my like chest or center of mass quite close to the
[2416.48s -> 2417.48s]  wall.
[2417.48s -> 2420.28s]  I do the same with my legs actually.
[2420.28s -> 2426.96s]  I actually use my feet quite a lot, but again, in a similar way to like utilize any inker.
[2426.96s -> 2432.56s]  I like Dan often would call it leg crimping many times with me, but it's kind of the same
[2432.56s -> 2433.96s]  thing you would do with your leg.
[2433.96s -> 2438.44s]  Like my knee, when my knees are flexed and I'm kind of like almost like you imagine you're
[2438.44s -> 2443.64s]  like digging away at the wall of your foot, use that to like pull your hips closer to
[2443.64s -> 2444.64s]  the wall as well.
[2444.64s -> 2446.64s]  I do lots of hip stretching as well.
[2446.64s -> 2451.72s]  So it allows me to get like quite close to the wall and obviously that makes the holds
[2451.72s -> 2456.24s]  feel more positive if your center of mass is really close to the wall.
[2456.24s -> 2457.80s]  Do you mind if I chime in again?
[2457.80s -> 2459.16s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2459.16s -> 2463.48s]  So I think what I'll do, because you're doing an amazing job right now of demonstrating
[2463.48s -> 2467.12s]  to me who can see you on the video, how you climb.
[2467.12s -> 2469.40s]  I can tell just from watching what you're doing.
[2469.40s -> 2473.52s]  So I think I'll make a video clip of what we're sharing right now, maybe like a three to four
[2473.52s -> 2474.52s]  minute clip.
[2474.60s -> 2478.32s]  I'll share it on Instagram so people can reference that.
[2478.32s -> 2482.28s]  If you're listening to the podcast, it should be published the same week as this episode
[2482.28s -> 2483.28s]  comes out.
[2483.28s -> 2486.00s]  So look out for that if you want to see what Aiden's talking about.
[2486.00s -> 2492.38s]  But yeah, just really simply like he is, Aiden's incredibly good at accessing the incut parts
[2492.38s -> 2498.42s]  of holds so that he can pull out on them and bring his chest in really close to the wall.
[2498.42s -> 2502.82s]  So imagine being like really, really squared up and just pulling your chest in tight with
[2502.82s -> 2505.22s]  your arm out to the side on little crimps.
[2505.22s -> 2506.98s]  And you're saying that you do the same thing with your feet.
[2506.98s -> 2512.14s]  So you're really looking for incut footholds so you can pull with your toe rather than
[2512.14s -> 2514.58s]  just pushing on the foothold.
[2514.58s -> 2516.90s]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2516.90s -> 2517.90s]  Exactly that.
[2517.90s -> 2522.38s]  So all of these little things would generally get me pretty close to the wall.
[2522.38s -> 2528.38s]  And I'm usually quite good at finding some stability there so I can hold those positions
[2528.38s -> 2530.10s]  quite isometrically.
[2530.10s -> 2536.18s]  So often I'll do a climb and I'll often be quite slow when I do the climbs.
[2536.18s -> 2539.10s]  So like you said on Jade, I made it look pretty easy.
[2539.10s -> 2545.14s]  I probably was, I can't quite remember exactly how hard I was trying, but things are working.
[2545.14s -> 2549.98s]  It's not like a walk in the park.
[2549.98s -> 2555.22s]  Things are going on, but just because the difficulty is holding an isometric position
[2555.22s -> 2561.78s]  as opposed to moving, it usually doesn't look that bad.
[2561.78s -> 2567.46s]  So that's basically, I feel like the mechanics of what really epitomizes what I'm good at
[2567.46s -> 2569.30s]  essentially.
[2569.30s -> 2575.34s]  And so in relation to the discussion we're having on Alfvén and how that compared to
[2575.34s -> 2579.58s]  those other top climbers, on Alfvén I climbed it, ended up climbing it really differently
[2579.58s -> 2583.90s]  to how Sean was, or I'm trying it differently to how Sean climbed it.
[2583.90s -> 2585.10s]  And Sean is very different.
[2585.98s -> 2591.06s]  He actually struggles a lot more in that high angle crimping finger position.
[2591.06s -> 2596.06s]  But he, I wonder if it's partly genetic as well, because Brooke's really good at it, is
[2596.06s -> 2597.54s]  amazing in a drag.
[2597.54s -> 2598.54s]  They're like incredible.
[2598.54s -> 2602.30s]  Robin's actually really good in a drag as well.
[2602.30s -> 2609.46s]  So I think maybe not genetic, but maybe physiology wise, which is something that does distinguish
[2609.46s -> 2610.46s]  myself.
[2610.46s -> 2614.18s]  I have like a really long pinky and a really short index.
[2614.26s -> 2615.46s]  Yeah, look at that.
[2615.46s -> 2618.50s]  Your index and pinky finger are almost the exact same length.
[2618.50s -> 2620.34s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2620.34s -> 2625.50s]  Which is quite strange, but that means that to be in a half crimp, my fingers are like
[2625.50s -> 2626.94s]  really open.
[2626.94s -> 2632.14s]  And so like if my pinky is straight, my other fingers are actually like pretty open.
[2632.14s -> 2637.26s]  And that means that you get even less like outward force.
[2637.26s -> 2644.18s]  But anyway, Sean is amazing in like a half crimp and especially a drag.
[2644.18s -> 2648.26s]  And obviously you can't really generate any force away from the hold using like in that
[2648.26s -> 2649.26s]  position.
[2649.26s -> 2653.50s]  Just because if you think about like dragging a hold and pulling outwards, like you literally
[2653.50s -> 2659.14s]  just pull your fingers off the wall, like that's a really good, because you're like reliant
[2659.14s -> 2666.02s]  on friction, but you have to like generate the force to produce that friction by moving
[2666.02s -> 2668.30s]  your body about the hold well.
[2668.30s -> 2673.14s]  And also like generating a lot of force with like the rest of your body to oppose it.
[2673.14s -> 2678.22s]  So generally like he uses his chest a lot and like he seems to be a lot more like front
[2678.22s -> 2679.78s]  body dominant.
[2679.78s -> 2686.38s]  And so if you look at the way he climbs up, he like is quite open on most of the holds.
[2686.38s -> 2691.82s]  There's a really interesting example on like down low, there's like you cross to an undercut
[2691.82s -> 2698.42s]  and both me and Sean readjust on this undercut for the next move, but he readjusts to open
[2698.42s -> 2701.14s]  his hand up more to stand into the undercut.
[2701.14s -> 2707.74s]  And I readjust to like fully close my hand into a full crimp, we're very different.
[2707.74s -> 2713.30s]  But yeah, he like, so he basically will be quite open handed on the holds and like, yeah,
[2713.30s -> 2716.74s]  use the rest of his body to oppose the holds quite well.
[2717.70s -> 2718.70s]  It's interesting.
[2718.70s -> 2719.70s]  Yeah.
[2719.70s -> 2723.26s]  He basically drags a lot of the holds, which I like to crimp up on.
[2723.26s -> 2727.38s]  But I think it's quite cool in it.
[2727.38s -> 2734.66s]  Alfvén is a cool boulder in that I was able to find a way like, find a way where I can
[2734.66s -> 2737.22s]  actually utilize the in-cut of the holds.
[2737.22s -> 2741.10s]  And I do use a slightly, I use all the same holds, but I use a slightly different like
[2741.10s -> 2744.70s]  sequence of them and generally leave my feet a bit lower.
[2744.70s -> 2751.70s]  And yeah, I kind of just, my sequence is quite different, but it was really interesting
[2751.70s -> 2755.66s]  to me to analyze how people do that.
[2755.66s -> 2759.58s]  And I don't know how much they like communicate all of it together.
[2759.58s -> 2767.22s]  They all seem like they're, I think Sean especially was impressive in like how susceptible he felt
[2767.22s -> 2773.10s]  to like learning about things that he seemed quite analytical about things as well.
[2773.14s -> 2780.18s]  I haven't had really explicit conversations about like climbing styles with him, but he
[2780.18s -> 2785.14s]  definitely seemed quite open-minded to like suggestions and was like, it seemed like he
[2785.14s -> 2787.30s]  was really looking at what was working for people.
[2787.30s -> 2792.86s]  And yes, it seems like he was making some quite interesting observations as well.
[2792.86s -> 2799.66s]  So I wonder how analytical he is about it too, but I definitely thought it was really
[2799.70s -> 2804.06s]  interesting for me how like it really emphasized how there's no real formula to be good at
[2804.06s -> 2806.90s]  something, especially in climbing.
[2806.90s -> 2808.58s]  Like it's so complex.
[2808.58s -> 2814.62s]  And I think that like relates to most climbers in that like you probably don't have to just
[2814.62s -> 2822.14s]  like go with the hype of what it is to be strong and actually like stop and consider what you're
[2822.14s -> 2829.14s]  good at and make sure that if the things that you want to do can be done in a way, in a
[2829.14s -> 2833.46s]  style which you're good at, like make sure the training that you're doing kind of
[2833.58s -> 2838.10s]  contributes something to how you're going to be doing something and not just like
[2838.46s -> 2839.46s]  training is training.
[2839.46s -> 2841.14s]  Like it can be so specific.
[2843.18s -> 2848.98s]  So I think, yeah, I've definitely thought a lot more about my style of climbing more
[2848.98s -> 2856.50s]  recently, just in recent years, I think probably partly because it felt like it's very
[2856.50s -> 2862.86s]  easy to spend a lot of time and energy training in a way which like isn't particularly
[2862.86s -> 2868.42s]  helpful. So it's definitely taken a bit of considering, but has felt very helpful.
[2868.50s -> 2873.78s]  It's felt much easier to do climbing outside because you can, you don't have to be such a
[2873.78s -> 2875.98s]  generalist. You can be a bit of a specialist.
[2876.46s -> 2878.94s]  And I think it's quite interesting, I think it's quite interesting.
[2879.94s -> 2885.14s]  Alfvén is slightly different to the other like 9a's I've thought about.
[2886.74s -> 2889.02s]  It seems like it can be climbed in different ways.
[2889.10s -> 2890.46s]  I mean, I don't really know.
[2890.58s -> 2895.58s]  I haven't really seen much of people, like trying return of the sleepwalker, but it seems
[2895.58s -> 2900.10s]  like there's a few 9a's which has now been done, like kind of like the glass ceiling has
[2900.10s -> 2904.90s]  been broken. It's a bit like less elusive in terms of like, I think people are pretty,
[2905.90s -> 2909.98s]  there's like confidence that 9a's exist these days where it's like, it was a bit like
[2909.98s -> 2910.50s]  mythical.
[2913.22s -> 2915.74s]  But like no 9a has been repeated yet.
[2915.82s -> 2920.38s]  And I think it's like probably a bit of a testament to like the specialist nature of
[2920.38s -> 2921.10s]  these climbers.
[2921.10s -> 2926.26s]  Like it's so rare to find something that fits so perfectly into someone's style.
[2927.62s -> 2931.94s]  But the reason is when they do and spend a lot of time doing it, it's probably really
[2932.86s -> 2933.38s]  hard.
[2935.38s -> 2941.22s]  It's quite hard for other people to try and like adapt that sequence to their own style.
[2941.54s -> 2944.22s]  And I mean, like, I think Alfvén's an exception to that.
[2944.54s -> 2944.82s]  Yeah.
[2945.94s -> 2950.26s]  I know, certainly, I'm sure we'll talk about it at some point, I went to try Burden of
[2950.50s -> 2959.30s]  Dreams and that felt like the formula that I usually use to tackle hard climbing or the
[2959.34s -> 2962.98s]  way I usually climb was not very helpful.
[2963.70s -> 2965.62s]  So it was kind of almost back to the drawing board.
[2967.50s -> 2972.18s]  And so I think it's probably partly one of the reasons why these really hard boulders
[2972.22s -> 2980.18s]  don't get many repeats because it usually takes, it takes a specialist to find a piece
[2980.18s -> 2983.14s]  of rock which aligns well with their specialty.
[2983.94s -> 2985.10s]  They spend a lot of time on it.
[2986.06s -> 2991.30s]  And that's kind of almost what constitutes a 9a these days, which makes them pretty hard.
[2991.70s -> 2992.46s]  I say these days.
[2995.86s -> 2997.46s]  No, well, that's what constitutes a 9a.
[2999.34s -> 3005.58s]  Yeah, no, it's definitely been an interesting thought process and it's definitely played
[3005.58s -> 3007.42s]  into a lot of my training.
[3007.58s -> 3017.22s]  And like the detail has been fun to try and implement into a more like general training
[3017.22s -> 3017.78s]  plan as well.
[3018.54s -> 3021.02s]  Okay, let's dive more deeply into that.
[3021.02s -> 3022.90s]  I really want to hear how you think about this.
[3023.46s -> 3026.98s]  You've already mentioned this, we've kind of talked around it a little bit, but one of
[3026.98s -> 3032.22s]  the things that stood out to me most from our first conversation, you mentioned that, you
[3032.22s -> 3036.94s]  know, it's really popular to focus on very simple, quote, tasks.
[3037.54s -> 3038.38s]  In our training.
[3039.94s -> 3041.06s]  Can you elaborate on that?
[3041.06s -> 3043.50s]  Can you tell me what you meant by that again?
[3043.50s -> 3047.70s]  And then I'm really curious to hear, because you've tried that and it didn't really work
[3047.70s -> 3048.26s]  that well for you.
[3048.26s -> 3052.34s]  So I'd love to hear you talk about that, but then contrasting that with how you think of
[3052.34s -> 3056.58s]  your training now and some of the staples that you include in your training, I think
[3056.58s -> 3057.54s]  would be really interesting.
[3057.58s -> 3060.34s]  And yeah, I'll just open it up to you.
[3060.34s -> 3062.38s]  But the simple tasks, what did you mean by that?
[3063.38s -> 3063.86s]  Yeah.
[3063.86s -> 3068.74s]  So I think like, usually people associate climbing training with trying to be strong.
[3069.02s -> 3073.14s]  I mean, obviously there's a bit about trying to be good as well, but lots of time people
[3073.14s -> 3079.10s]  maybe spend a lot of time trying to be strong and often the definition of being strong for
[3079.10s -> 3085.86s]  climbing, which often motivates people's training is like, it's quite reductive or like the
[3086.06s -> 3092.70s]  metrics for being strong will be like, generally will be simple things like doing a one
[3092.70s -> 3095.90s]  armor or hanging on an edge with a bunch of weight.
[3097.10s -> 3101.74s]  And it's almost like if you're bad at those, you're weaker.
[3101.94s -> 3106.90s]  And so you can climb well because you're good, but not because you're strong, which like,
[3107.70s -> 3112.26s]  I definitely like on top of that, they're almost so like party tricks, like it's quite
[3112.30s -> 3115.62s]  fun to be able to like do a bunch of one armors.
[3115.62s -> 3119.90s]  And like, it's quite a nice feeling, like to be able to generate that kind of force.
[3120.42s -> 3126.18s]  So I definitely got sucked into that at times and was like quite disheartened by being bad
[3126.18s -> 3131.82s]  at it. Like I'm not like terrible at it, but like compared to most people I've trained
[3131.82s -> 3136.82s]  with, like I've trained with like one of my really good friends, Jim Pope from the UK,
[3137.18s -> 3141.34s]  who's really good at this kind of these metrics of strength.
[3141.86s -> 3146.30s]  And it's always been confusing because like outdoors on small holds, I'm usually a bit
[3146.30s -> 3147.26s]  better than he is.
[3147.38s -> 3153.54s]  But as soon as we get like inside onto a fingerboard or a bar, like I look like a total
[3153.54s -> 3160.98s]  novice. And at times I think like not in that specific example, like not in my relationship
[3160.98s -> 3167.42s]  with Jim, but like just in general, like I think I'd been frustrated by it and like
[3167.86s -> 3170.82s]  tried to train it because I was like, I shouldn't be bad at this.
[3170.86s -> 3176.94s]  Like this is something that I need to be good at, but was finding that I put a load of
[3176.94s -> 3182.22s]  energy into it and time and like kind of like almost important.
[3182.42s -> 3184.18s]  I put like a lot of value in it as well.
[3184.90s -> 3187.50s]  And it was making very little difference to my climbing.
[3188.02s -> 3194.90s]  And it just really didn't apply very well to the style in which I climb, like on the
[3194.90s -> 3200.74s]  discussion of the mechanics, I very rarely climb in a half grimp and there was like
[3200.78s -> 3206.50s]  actually not that much crossover for me in like that perfect style.
[3206.54s -> 3211.46s]  And obviously it helps on the like, there's a lot of stuff it does help on, but like for
[3211.50s -> 3213.94s]  the things that I was trying to do, it wasn't particularly useful.
[3214.38s -> 3218.98s]  And I think there's like, there's other reasons why they're so popular as well.
[3218.98s -> 3223.90s]  Like, I think like it's something that's very relatable in that, like that's become
[3223.90s -> 3225.14s]  very popular in recent years.
[3225.14s -> 3230.02s]  You see it with like the rise of like standardized boards and things, which are
[3230.02s -> 3235.90s]  like blowing up at the moment, but like until for pretty much most of like climbing's
[3235.90s -> 3238.90s]  life, like you couldn't really, that wasn't a thing.
[3239.10s -> 3245.46s]  And so the things which you couldn't measure were like an edge size because
[3245.50s -> 3248.82s]  while Beastmakers have been around for years, but like they're everywhere.
[3248.82s -> 3253.74s]  So like people could, that was like a form of training where people could relate to
[3253.74s -> 3257.26s]  like, Oh, Alex Magos can hold this with 30 kilos.
[3257.26s -> 3259.02s]  Like that's what it is to be strong.
[3259.54s -> 3262.18s]  And like a bar is the same anywhere in the world.
[3262.18s -> 3267.02s]  So if you can do 10 one-armers on it, you can do 10 one-armers in America or Europe.
[3267.86s -> 3271.62s]  And so it was kind of like a way to like connect these feats of strength and that
[3271.62s -> 3272.22s]  kind of thing.
[3273.22s -> 3274.78s]  I think that is quite cool.
[3274.86s -> 3278.74s]  And I mean, like that, obviously that concept has captivated people's
[3278.74s -> 3282.78s]  imaginations because it's like, they're like the kilter boards and all of that
[3282.94s -> 3285.78s]  moon boards and they're doing really well and people love them.
[3286.18s -> 3287.30s]  And it is really cool.
[3287.82s -> 3292.38s]  I guess I'm more climbing specific, but I think it can kind of lead you down a
[3292.38s -> 3299.46s]  path of having your like intermediate goals being training related, not actually
[3299.46s -> 3302.38s]  applying well to perhaps what you're actually trying to do.
[3302.70s -> 3307.74s]  So I think why, what I kind of really changed and would like mostly encourage
[3307.74s -> 3313.86s]  people to as well, it's like if you set yourself a goal or want to do something
[3314.38s -> 3319.62s]  to make sure that all of the training that you do is like kind of aligned well
[3319.62s -> 3323.06s]  with that, or it's like considers to why it would be helpful to what you're trying
[3323.06s -> 3324.42s]  to do, if that makes sense.
[3324.94s -> 3326.66s]  Is that kind of what you meant by simple tasks?
[3327.14s -> 3328.46s]  Yes, that's exactly what I meant.
[3328.50s -> 3328.82s]  Yeah.
[3329.18s -> 3329.54s]  Yeah.
[3329.66s -> 3330.54s]  And it's funny.
[3330.54s -> 3334.86s]  I'm like kind of laughing at myself because I'm sure I have perpetuated this
[3335.34s -> 3339.86s]  issue, if we can call it an issue or this propensity towards reductionism and
[3339.86s -> 3343.22s]  training, because I'm like, all I want in my life is to be able to hang the beast
[3343.22s -> 3344.86s]  maker center edge with one arm, you know?
[3345.46s -> 3347.54s]  Um, cause that's always been really hard for me.
[3347.58s -> 3352.10s]  And, you know, in general, climbing on steeper terrain and loading up my
[3352.10s -> 3356.46s]  fingers more versus the background I have climbing at Smith rock, which is very
[3356.46s -> 3360.74s]  fingery it's on tiny holds, but a lot of your weights on your feet, climbing on a
[3360.74s -> 3364.78s]  steeper board with more weight on my hands has been incredibly helpful, but.
[3365.42s -> 3366.58s]  I think you're totally right.
[3366.58s -> 3370.30s]  Like over focusing on just being able to one arm hanging edge.
[3371.66s -> 3374.90s]  I mean, I don't, yeah, that's not really going to lead me to, to my goals.
[3374.90s -> 3379.66s]  And I probably climb in a way I actually do use that type of grip quite often.
[3379.74s -> 3383.10s]  Um, and even so the applicability is, you know, not amazing.
[3383.10s -> 3385.30s]  So yeah, point well taken.
[3385.30s -> 3386.30s]  I think this is really great.
[3386.30s -> 3387.94s]  I think it'd be really interesting to hear.
[3388.82s -> 3390.26s]  You talk about two different things.
[3390.34s -> 3396.50s]  Um, a lot of people after the conversation with Dan, especially wanted to hear how
[3396.50s -> 3401.26s]  you got so good, how you've gotten so good at the high angle crimp style that you
[3401.26s -> 3404.98s]  climb in, um, and you can tackle that however, however you want.
[3404.98s -> 3408.62s]  I don't know if you train your fingers specifically for that, or if it's just
[3409.14s -> 3412.06s]  doing all the board climbing that you do kind of in that style.
[3412.70s -> 3414.98s]  Um, so I think that'd be, let's start with that.
[3414.98s -> 3417.06s]  And then I think it'd be really interesting to hear.
[3418.22s -> 3420.74s]  Let's go back to the very start of this conversation with those
[3420.74s -> 3422.50s]  bullet points with Alfvén.
[3422.50s -> 3426.34s]  Like, how are you getting very, very specific with your preparation for this
[3426.34s -> 3428.50s]  specific boulder you want to do this fall?
[3429.54s -> 3429.78s]  Yeah.
[3429.78s -> 3430.10s]  Yeah.
[3430.14s -> 3431.54s]  Um, yeah, no, absolutely.
[3431.54s -> 3436.14s]  So, uh, uh, shall I do the former first?
[3436.14s -> 3438.42s]  And then, yeah, let's do it.
[3438.42s -> 3439.54s]  Let's do the high angle crimps.
[3439.54s -> 3439.98s]  Like, yeah.
[3439.98s -> 3441.22s]  How did you get so good at this?
[3442.14s -> 3451.30s]  Um, yeah, I kind of, I guess like I've actually always been like, my tendency
[3451.30s -> 3453.70s]  has always been to towards small holds.
[3453.82s -> 3460.18s]  Um, I think quite early on in my days of climbing, Dan actually started
[3460.18s -> 3464.14s]  like almost mentoring me and we kind of realized that I didn't really have
[3464.14s -> 3469.50s]  regular access to climbing walls so much with the temperamental weather in the
[3469.50s -> 3473.38s]  lakes, you kind of need somewhere and you can train as well, um, cause it's,
[3473.66s -> 3476.74s]  especially for winter, permanently wet.
[3477.06s -> 3482.82s]  Um, so, uh, he, he helped me set up a board, uh, uh, in my stable, which is
[3482.86s -> 3484.02s]  still the board I use today.
[3484.74s -> 3488.74s]  And I think just the nature of that, that's a 50 degree board.
[3489.34s -> 3494.14s]  Um, and so quite quickly, the majority of my training was down there.
[3495.06s -> 3503.02s]  And at the time, I think as I got better or more used to climbing on a board,
[3503.18s -> 3507.58s]  cause before that I'd kind of just been climbing and climbing walls, um, around
[3507.62s -> 3513.38s]  the lakes, uh, I ended up like adapting almost a style of the board to like the
[3513.38s -> 3515.94s]  outdoor climbing around the Lake district.
[3516.86s -> 3520.34s]  And often the holds are a lot smaller and a lot in cut, more in cut.
[3520.38s -> 3525.06s]  So I think like generally that led to me functioning on small holds
[3525.06s -> 3526.70s]  became quite like familiar to me.
[3527.02s -> 3531.82s]  Um, but I do actually remember even in the earlier days of my climbing, uh, I'd
[3531.86s -> 3538.38s]  be quite, uh, quite focused on wanting to do climbs.
[3538.38s -> 3545.02s]  Well, uh, like if I do a boulder and I was fellow scrappy, I'd do it again.
[3545.78s -> 3549.74s]  And I think I never really quite realized this until much later on that would have
[3549.74s -> 3553.38s]  been like four years into my climbing three or four years into my climbing.
[3553.38s -> 3557.54s]  I set my board up like maybe three years into my climbing or so.
[3557.74s -> 3559.62s]  Um, how old were you when you started?
[3560.38s -> 3563.94s]  Uh, about 12 or 13.
[3564.10s -> 3564.38s]  Okay.
[3564.46s -> 3568.90s]  Um, and yeah, but again, quite like a proper hobbyist would go
[3568.90s -> 3570.10s]  after school every now and again.
[3570.38s -> 3575.30s]  Um, and then when I turned 14, I could go unsupervised.
[3575.74s -> 3579.70s]  And so I just went by myself, but just for a little climbing wall, um, and
[3579.70s -> 3585.14s]  kind of outgrew it, um, before long and then went up to climbing wall that
[3585.26s -> 3587.98s]  Dan's wife owns up in Carlisle in rock.
[3588.66s -> 3592.90s]  And I was like a regular there, but then that's quite a long way.
[3592.94s -> 3595.42s]  So public transport in the lakes is awful as well.
[3595.94s -> 3598.78s]  Um, so quite quickly needed to, um, have somewhere I
[3598.78s -> 3600.70s]  could access a bit more easily.
[3601.42s -> 3605.10s]  But, um, yeah, I remember in my mind, I'm not quite sure where it
[3605.10s -> 3609.38s]  derotes, like where I derived it from, but to climb something well, for me
[3609.38s -> 3612.82s]  was felt like everything was in control.
[3613.42s -> 3617.14s]  And so like, if there was no uncertainty about doing the moves.
[3617.18s -> 3622.26s]  And so every move was like, felt like it was like, there was no moment
[3622.26s -> 3626.78s]  where I was out of control that was like, for me, how I do something nicely.
[3627.54s -> 3635.38s]  And I think the easiest way to have, uh, no uncertainty about doing a move is
[3635.38s -> 3640.94s]  often like by doing it quite statically or like not necessarily statically, but
[3640.94s -> 3644.86s]  like you were able to get the hold it, the slow you're moving, the more
[3644.86s -> 3646.50s]  precise you can be on each hold.
[3646.50s -> 3650.94s]  And, uh, I think there was a lot in like what I was holding, but I also
[3650.94s -> 3653.94s]  like really like the feeling of moving on a board and was quite in tune with
[3653.94s -> 3656.54s]  like just the feeling of being in control.
[3656.94s -> 3661.58s]  So I kind of never really realized I was doing it at the time, but it was
[3661.58s -> 3663.78s]  always quite switched onto that.
[3664.58s -> 3669.38s]  And so I actually think it sounds, it sounds quite trivial, but like, I
[3669.38s -> 3674.46s]  think the warmup routine that I developed on my board, because it was
[3674.46s -> 3678.94s]  like, there were boulders that were slightly like below my limit, I wasn't
[3678.94s -> 3683.90s]  like at the living end and I kind of would had a tendency to go to that style
[3683.90s -> 3687.58s]  where like, I'd almost like stop in front of every hold, almost like, not
[3687.58s -> 3691.70s]  like I wouldn't necessarily hover in front of every hold, but I would feel
[3691.70s -> 3694.78s]  like I could, so it feels like I could stop at any point in the movement
[3695.10s -> 3696.34s]  before grabbing the next hold.
[3697.06s -> 3702.26s]  And I realized I started doing this on client, like, as I got better, I'd
[3702.26s -> 3707.70s]  start taking clients, which used to be quite snatchy for me and like, almost
[3707.70s -> 3712.46s]  like bullying them into this style to the point where like, I could get it to
[3712.46s -> 3716.06s]  the point where I could stop at any point in the movement if I wanted to.
[3716.62s -> 3720.22s]  Uh, and that level of control was something that like, I was
[3720.22s -> 3721.54s]  always quite fascinated by.
[3721.82s -> 3726.90s]  So I think like, what I went looking for was actually like the feeling of it,
[3727.26s -> 3732.54s]  but I like kind of stumbled into that like style of climbing, which really
[3732.54s -> 3737.14s]  has like become like the niche of climbing, which I've done, uh, that
[3737.14s -> 3740.86s]  I've like done all right in, uh, in recent years.
[3742.14s -> 3746.46s]  So I think that was probably like the early days, how I got into that style.
[3746.98s -> 3751.26s]  I think like the high angle crimping, I mentioned a little bit about the
[3751.26s -> 3756.58s]  physiology of fingers, and I think like essentially, unless something is quite
[3756.58s -> 3761.78s]  slopey, I would very rarely climb in a half grip anyway, just because my pinky
[3761.78s -> 3765.78s]  is so long and for my pinky to be straight, my other fingers have to be
[3765.78s -> 3770.94s]  really open and so it almost has to be like a slope for me to climb in that
[3770.94s -> 3771.42s]  position.
[3771.70s -> 3776.86s]  So even if something's not very in cut, usually I will end up holding it with a
[3776.86s -> 3780.22s]  slightly flexed pinky as well, even if it's not really acutely flexed.
[3780.82s -> 3785.58s]  And so I think because of that, I like kind of became quite used to that
[3785.58s -> 3786.18s]  position.
[3786.46s -> 3792.90s]  Um, and then it was actually probably, I wasn't so old when me and Dan
[3792.90s -> 3799.82s]  stumbled across the, um, sling training or sling testing, um, he had to chat
[3799.82s -> 3801.62s]  with you about, and I actually did.
[3801.62s -> 3805.22s]  Uh, so that was really interesting when we stumbled across that, we had a lot
[3805.22s -> 3806.54s]  of chats about, about that.
[3806.70s -> 3813.22s]  And, uh, it was, I'm just trying to think if that was before, I think it was about
[3813.26s -> 3818.78s]  around the time when, um, I took a bad fall when I was quite young in Fontainebleau
[3819.30s -> 3825.50s]  and, uh, had, um, like reconstructed my calcaneus that like shattered my heel.
[3825.94s -> 3829.62s]  Um, so I had quite a long recovery process from that.
[3829.78s -> 3834.82s]  Um, I had like four months or something of not climbing, um, and was just like
[3834.82s -> 3836.70s]  climbing footless on my board.
[3836.98s -> 3840.90s]  Um, I'm doing a lot of finger boarding and a lot of like upper body stuff
[3840.90s -> 3841.54s]  basically.
[3841.70s -> 3844.66s]  Um, and it was, that was like quite surreal.
[3844.70s -> 3849.30s]  I was very much like, uh, I had like, I was relatively good on small holds, but
[3849.30s -> 3850.90s]  like very technical climber.
[3851.18s -> 3856.54s]  Um, and it was quite funny then going back into climbing, having done like a
[3856.54s -> 3860.62s]  four month block of like power, upper body training and turning, trying to
[3860.62s -> 3864.94s]  remember to climb again, but also being able to like pull on holds, which I
[3864.94s -> 3865.74s]  couldn't before.
[3865.82s -> 3870.42s]  Um, it was quite a funny time, but my fingers got quite strong in that spell
[3870.42s -> 3870.90s]  actually.
[3871.78s -> 3875.94s]  And that was around the time when like that we were starting to like experiment
[3875.98s -> 3877.18s]  with that sling stuff.
[3877.34s -> 3880.74s]  And I started getting quite good on the small holds.
[3880.86s -> 3882.94s]  And I think there was a couple of sessions we had to run down.
[3882.94s -> 3884.90s]  It was like, oh, okay.
[3884.94s -> 3887.06s]  He's got, he's got me on the little tiny crimp.
[3888.06s -> 3893.38s]  It was like a little transition period where I started having him on the small
[3893.38s -> 3893.82s]  holds.
[3894.34s -> 3900.18s]  And, uh, I think we like analyze a lot of like the weights and like kind of like
[3900.70s -> 3903.18s]  adding up or like the weights we could hang on our fingers.
[3903.18s -> 3907.86s]  And it's quite, it's, I mean, I've still, I'm still quite fascinated by it today.
[3907.86s -> 3908.90s]  I haven't understood it all.
[3910.82s -> 3916.22s]  And I think like stumbling across that, like kind of, I began to understand what
[3916.22s -> 3920.14s]  it was that I was good at and why, like I struggled to hang on an edge, but I was
[3920.14s -> 3923.46s]  good on small holds and it kind of like was beginning to make a bit more sense.
[3923.46s -> 3925.74s]  And I was kind of piecing this puzzle together a little bit.
[3926.26s -> 3932.38s]  Um, and I did actually do quite a lot of training with those mono slings.
[3932.54s -> 3936.14s]  Um, I think it's like, it's a funny form of training.
[3936.14s -> 3938.26s]  I think it like strains your lumbar core quite a lot.
[3938.54s -> 3943.94s]  Um, so I was always quite careful to, I never actually injured my
[3943.94s -> 3944.82s]  lumbar cores doing it.
[3944.86s -> 3947.62s]  I did actually want to injure my pinky doing it.
[3947.98s -> 3952.42s]  Um, but, uh, it wasn't actually, it wasn't so bad.
[3952.58s -> 3956.54s]  Um, but I never actually, I never actually damaged my lumbar cores in doing it, uh,
[3956.54s -> 3958.38s]  in like doing that mono sling training.
[3958.50s -> 3964.10s]  But, uh, I definitely would feel like quite a strange level of like, uh, it was
[3964.10s -> 3967.38s]  good for isolating certain fingers and like understanding weaknesses.
[3967.78s -> 3969.58s]  I think Dan might've mentioned this as well.
[3969.58s -> 3975.42s]  I would rarely use it as like a training technique, but more like a testing
[3975.42s -> 3978.54s]  technique to kind of understand where it's at.
[3978.74s -> 3980.22s]  And I do use it a lot for rehab.
[3980.26s -> 3986.30s]  So, um, if I've got like a finger that is injured and I want quite a measured rehab,
[3986.34s -> 3988.10s]  you can obviously isolate a single finger.
[3988.62s -> 3991.94s]  And that's way better than just like hanging on an edge and
[3991.94s -> 3993.34s]  conversating with your other fingers.
[3994.86s -> 3999.26s]  Uh, so I, it's hard to tell exactly where it came from, but I think like,
[3999.26s -> 4001.66s]  I always had a tendency to that style of climbing.
[4002.22s -> 4009.26s]  And then I think once I realized that that was the movement that I enjoyed, I
[4009.26s -> 4013.46s]  like kind of would adopt that style when I could and that like in turn kind of just
[4013.46s -> 4018.02s]  like, yeah, I think the style I enjoyed ended up being the style I was good at,
[4018.06s -> 4022.22s]  which I think will be the case for most people, whether they know how they climb
[4022.22s -> 4026.98s]  or not, but, uh, I think it's definitely helpful to kind of understand the
[4027.02s -> 4030.90s]  mechanics of what you're good at or the way you like to climb.
[4031.26s -> 4035.90s]  Um, and I think most of the time, unless someone's always been quite switched
[4035.90s -> 4040.66s]  on to working their weaknesses, people will probably be good at the
[4040.66s -> 4042.42s]  way they in some way enjoy.
[4043.42s -> 4045.10s]  Can I summarize all that back to you?
[4046.22s -> 4047.02s]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[4047.02s -> 4048.42s]  See if it feels like it fits.
[4048.46s -> 4049.42s]  Um, yeah.
[4049.42s -> 4055.02s]  So what I'm hearing you say is that you just always really enjoyed the sensation
[4055.02s -> 4058.82s]  of feeling really locked in on moves, feeling really controlled and really
[4058.82s -> 4063.42s]  static on moves and probably your finger physiology, just the lengths of your
[4063.42s -> 4068.14s]  different fingers led you to be stronger in that high angle crimp position, being
[4068.14s -> 4072.54s]  able to pull outward on the, on the holds because your pinky is pretty long.
[4072.54s -> 4076.30s]  So the half crimp, you're not getting that dragged pinky and a half
[4076.30s -> 4077.46s]  crimp like a lot of people would.
[4078.22s -> 4080.42s]  And then you just always climb that way because you're good at it
[4080.42s -> 4081.74s]  because you enjoy that sensation.
[4081.74s -> 4082.54s]  That's how you climb.
[4082.54s -> 4083.82s]  That's how you've continued to climb.
[4083.82s -> 4085.02s]  That's how you train on the board.
[4085.02s -> 4086.46s]  That's how you warm up on the board.
[4087.02s -> 4090.18s]  And so you, it makes sense that you've just gotten better and better
[4090.18s -> 4091.30s]  and better and better at it.
[4091.70s -> 4096.22s]  And then experimenting with the sling test with Dan, um, you know, for instance,
[4096.22s -> 4100.54s]  for people that haven't heard that episode, just crimping one finger in
[4100.54s -> 4105.14s]  isolation and picking up a weight off the ground, using a sling around your
[4105.14s -> 4108.18s]  fingertip, that's what Dan and I talked about measuring each
[4108.18s -> 4110.06s]  finger's strength in isolation.
[4110.70s -> 4115.42s]  It sounds like that just helped you understand why you were good at that
[4115.62s -> 4119.50s]  versus it's not like you did the test and then realize like, oh, I need to
[4119.50s -> 4122.78s]  work on this, this, this, and this, and then develop this sort of finger
[4122.78s -> 4127.34s]  strength that seems like the test helped you understand, oh, I I'm very, very
[4127.34s -> 4130.90s]  good at this because of this static way that I climb, does that all resonate
[4130.90s -> 4132.78s]  with you and does that feel like I'm getting it right?
[4133.94s -> 4134.50s]  Yeah.
[4134.50s -> 4135.34s]  Yeah, definitely.
[4135.46s -> 4140.74s]  And I think, I think part of the understanding of why, why it was that I
[4140.74s -> 4145.82s]  was good on those style of holds kind of in turn did help me progress in that
[4145.82s -> 4151.30s]  style as well in that, like, I kind of realized that my passion for climbing
[4151.30s -> 4153.34s]  didn't lie in hanging on edges.
[4153.42s -> 4159.18s]  And so I kind of was like less caught up in the fact that I wasn't a mega
[4159.18s -> 4165.22s]  wad on a beast maker, but, um, but could like kind of spend a bit more time
[4165.22s -> 4168.10s]  focusing on the things which were helpful.
[4168.34s -> 4173.18s]  So I would like, I have done like, um, I have done like a lot of fingerboard
[4173.18s -> 4174.46s]  sessions in that position.
[4174.46s -> 4179.26s]  So when I like do train in that position, like that, like high angle crimping
[4179.26s -> 4182.02s]  position, I usually don't wrap my thumbs over.
[4182.42s -> 4186.94s]  Um, I usually just keep, uh, keep the thumbs below, below my fingers, but I
[4186.94s -> 4189.90s]  would train in that position because I knew that that was like way more
[4189.90s -> 4191.30s]  applicable for me.
[4191.58s -> 4197.10s]  Um, and like definitely doing a sling test, uh, was interesting, uh, in that
[4197.10s -> 4200.62s]  it really, I really understood my indexes were really weak.
[4200.94s -> 4206.18s]  Um, uh, I was definitely like the back of my hands did a lot more than the front.
[4206.62s -> 4211.70s]  And so I did do quite a lot of training, um, to like kind of assist that.
[4211.78s -> 4217.34s]  And I think especially that is quite helpful because sometimes when you climb,
[4217.70s -> 4222.26s]  uh, on a hold, which like is too narrow for all four of your fingers and requires
[4222.26s -> 4229.26s]  free, I used to always preference back free over front free in a crimp.
[4229.30s -> 4229.70s]  Yeah.
[4229.70s -> 4230.22s]  Interesting.
[4231.02s -> 4236.42s]  I'd always like, uh, that would be like definitely stronger for me, but, uh, Dan
[4236.42s -> 4240.26s]  spoke about this a little bit as well, about the benefits of dragging the
[4240.26s -> 4241.62s]  mobility, it gives you a wrist.
[4241.86s -> 4243.62s]  It's kind of the same back free and front free.
[4243.62s -> 4247.78s]  Like you get a lot more mobility crimping front free than you do back free really.
[4247.94s -> 4252.42s]  Um, and so it is really good to be able to climb and holds like that.
[4252.66s -> 4257.94s]  So I think that kind of indicated things, which I were limitations for me.
[4258.14s -> 4263.30s]  And that has been something that has been like, that's been like a weakness,
[4263.38s -> 4266.50s]  which I've observed, which have been like, wow, that is a weakness, which is
[4267.30s -> 4271.62s]  so has been something I've actively worked on and it has helped.
[4272.02s -> 4276.66s]  So, uh, I think like, I'm not saying like understand what you're good at and only
[4276.66s -> 4283.14s]  train that I think it's understand what you want to do and what, what is stopping
[4283.14s -> 4289.22s]  you doing it and then like align your training or your preparation, uh, to make
[4289.22s -> 4291.14s]  sure it fits.
[4291.38s -> 4292.74s]  Yeah, that's cool.
[4293.38s -> 4296.02s]  But yeah, no, yeah, that was just a continuation.
[4296.02s -> 4297.46s]  It was a good summer.
[4297.70s -> 4302.82s]  Would you be willing to share your sling test numbers with me so I can, I can link
[4302.82s -> 4304.66s]  to them so people can look at them.
[4304.82s -> 4306.18s]  Do you have those numbers?
[4306.34s -> 4309.46s]  I'm just trying to think what I, I'm just trying to think.
[4309.46s -> 4317.46s]  Matt, I think I once did 20, 20.5 kilos on my pinkies in a cramp.
[4317.70s -> 4317.94s]  Yeah.
[4317.94s -> 4322.66s]  And in a, in a current position for reference for people, I tested my pinkies in a
[4322.66s -> 4325.62s]  current position and I think my max was nine kilos.
[4325.86s -> 4332.26s]  So Aiden's got 11 and a half kilos on each pinky on me, which is pretty amazing.
[4333.70s -> 4336.26s]  That's definitely, it's not consistent for all my fingers.
[4336.26s -> 4336.74s]  Yeah, yeah.
[4337.62s -> 4338.74s]  Like that's, that was, um.
[4338.74s -> 4341.78s]  Well, you're also one of the best boulders in the world and I'm, you know, I'm
[4341.78s -> 4343.22s]  hoping to climb V12 someday.
[4343.22s -> 4344.66s]  So there's a big gap between us.
[4344.66s -> 4345.46s]  So it makes sense.
[4345.46s -> 4346.74s]  But yeah.
[4346.74s -> 4350.90s]  But, um, yeah, I think also if you were to look at other fingers, there'd be a lot
[4350.90s -> 4351.86s]  less disparity.
[4352.50s -> 4356.82s]  Because I know, I know my indexes were much weaker.
[4356.82s -> 4361.06s]  I think I maybe did like 16 kilos on my indexes.
[4361.06s -> 4361.38s]  Okay.
[4361.38s -> 4365.06s]  Um, I can't quite, my middle two, I can't quite remember.
[4365.06s -> 4368.18s]  I don't think I ever really went those completely max.
[4368.18s -> 4368.50s]  Okay.
[4368.50s -> 4372.74s]  Um, so I'm a bit unsure about my exact data doing that.
[4372.74s -> 4378.90s]  I also was, I know the thing which isn't always common with when I added it all up.
[4378.90s -> 4382.74s]  So I, I've done it using like picking up weights off the floor, using a swing, or I
[4382.74s -> 4386.34s]  have like a little, like mono, which I kind of made.
[4386.34s -> 4393.30s]  Um, so it's like measurable, the depth that my finger goes, goes into the, um, into
[4393.30s -> 4394.90s]  like the hold you pick up.
[4394.90s -> 4399.78s]  Um, but I have done it on a force plate before, like doing like the mono crimps, but
[4400.34s -> 4406.10s]  almost not entirely hanging, but, uh, you, you like pull down on it and it's attached
[4406.10s -> 4406.90s]  to a force place.
[4406.90s -> 4408.50s]  So you can measure the force.
[4408.50s -> 4414.34s]  Um, I did this like, uh, with, I've started working with, well, for the past three years,
[4414.34s -> 4416.74s]  I've been working with Ollie Tor.
[4416.74s -> 4421.30s]  I think, um, uh, I think he might be having a chance at some point.
[4421.30s -> 4421.46s]  Yeah.
[4421.46s -> 4422.34s]  I hope so.
[4422.34s -> 4423.06s]  Yeah.
[4423.06s -> 4429.38s]  So, um, yeah, I started working with him when I was like transitioning to just being a rock
[4429.38s -> 4430.26s]  climber.
[4430.26s -> 4434.74s]  And so it's been quite interesting because they obviously do a lot of testing and lots
[4434.74s -> 4440.34s]  of that testing data is based around what are the, like the quite measurable exercises
[4440.34s -> 4441.30s]  we discussed earlier.
[4442.10s -> 4448.10s]  And I think it is quite interesting because usually they like get correlations from that
[4448.10s -> 4451.70s]  data and try and determine like what people could be climbing.
[4452.42s -> 4457.86s]  Uh, when they get like an obvious, like when they see trends in the data, they're like
[4457.86s -> 4461.78s]  established, like F4, like a algorithm.
[4461.78s -> 4466.02s]  So that if you input your data that you should be able to predict how hard you can climb.
[4466.02s -> 4469.78s]  And I think I'm probably a bit of an outlier in that system in that I'm probably a bit
[4469.78s -> 4471.46s]  crap on the tests.
[4472.34s -> 4477.14s]  So I think we, we did a few tests and the, like, initially it was like kind of confirmed
[4477.14s -> 4477.62s]  what I knew.
[4477.62s -> 4483.70s]  And he was like, oh yeah, like, you're not like, you're not crap, but like, yeah, you've
[4483.70s -> 4487.46s]  definitely got a lot, a lot, like a long way to go in this.
[4487.46s -> 4490.18s]  But then we started being a bit more detailed with the data.
[4490.90s -> 4497.38s]  And I know when we tested my individual fingers, I should try and maybe if we do a follow-up
[4497.38s -> 4499.78s]  one, I'll get, I'll try and get the data off Ollie.
[4499.78s -> 4500.66s]  Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[4501.38s -> 4505.62s]  Um, cause we did do like the individual fingers and added them up.
[4505.62s -> 4508.58s]  And I think it was something, it was quite traumatic.
[4508.58s -> 4514.82s]  It was like 160% of the force I could produce when all of my fingers were together.
[4514.82s -> 4515.22s]  Huh?
[4515.22s -> 4515.38s]  Wow.
[4516.10s -> 4516.98s]  Fascinating.
[4517.54s -> 4518.82s]  Yeah, it's quite strange.
[4518.82s -> 4525.70s]  Um, I remember being a bit confused by it, but, uh, yeah, I think being able to like
[4525.70s -> 4530.10s]  produce a lot of force in that position, like in isolated fingers, I think it's quite helpful
[4530.10s -> 4535.30s]  for outside where the holds are often less, um, ergonomic.
[4535.30s -> 4536.42s]  So like less uniform.
[4537.30s -> 4537.62s]  Yeah.
[4537.62s -> 4542.58s]  Lots of the time hold manufacturers understandably make the holds comfortable.
[4542.66s -> 4548.42s]  Whereas mother nature is often never so kind and we end up crimping up on that crystal.
[4548.42s -> 4549.30s]  Yeah, totally.
[4549.30s -> 4550.02s]  Totally.
[4550.02s -> 4550.52s]  Yeah.
[4550.66s -> 4555.70s]  Um, so, uh, yeah, no, I, I should, I'll try and get that data for you.
[4555.70s -> 4556.20s]  Okay.
[4556.98s -> 4557.22s]  Yeah.
[4557.22s -> 4559.94s]  I remember my pink, my pinkies were like my little party trick.
[4559.94s -> 4567.06s]  It was somewhere that was quite good, but I haven't tested it in a while.
[4567.06s -> 4567.62s]  Okay.
[4567.62s -> 4568.10s]  Okay, cool.
[4568.10s -> 4569.94s]  I can't vouch for what they're at now.
[4569.94s -> 4574.90s]  Um, just purely out of curiosity, because I think of you as someone who has like some
[4574.90s -> 4578.82s]  of the strongest fingers in the world, but as we've been talking about, it's, it's very
[4578.82s -> 4580.66s]  specific to the style in which you climb.
[4581.46s -> 4587.38s]  Um, how strong are you on like the Beastmaker 2000 center edge just for context for people?
[4588.50s -> 4593.86s]  Uh, so actually I don't really, I'm just trying to think how much I could hang on that.
[4593.86s -> 4596.02s]  I probably haven't really tried it in the past couple of years.
[4596.02s -> 4598.34s]  I basically don't really use that edge.
[4598.34s -> 4600.50s]  I use like the outside ones more.
[4600.50s -> 4605.06s]  So essentially I found with that edge as well, your pinky end up doing so much.
[4605.06s -> 4611.06s]  Cause, cause it's big enough to like, kind of nestle a lot of like the skin on, on the
[4611.06s -> 4611.38s]  edge.
[4611.38s -> 4616.98s]  I found one, it was like trash my pinky skin, but I also found that you'd need quite a big
[4616.98s -> 4618.82s]  hole outside to have the same.
[4619.46s -> 4620.26s]  Like impact.
[4620.82s -> 4625.94s]  So I don't really test, or if I would hang on it, I'd have my pinky like retracted to
[4625.94s -> 4628.98s]  the edge, um, cause it felt much more applicable.
[4628.98s -> 4635.46s]  Um, so I guess like maybe for like a little, uh, a little gauge of where people are, it
[4635.46s -> 4636.74s]  would be good for me to try it.
[4636.74s -> 4641.46s]  But, um, I would always focus on like the outside edges, which are much smaller and
[4641.46s -> 4647.38s]  you just be on like the tip of your pinky, but like on the outside edge, like it would
[4647.38s -> 4649.54s]  take a good day for me to hang it body weight.
[4649.54s -> 4654.74s]  Like I can probably like, yeah, on a good day, I could probably do five seconds body
[4654.74s -> 4656.98s]  weight on that, but I wouldn't really be adding weight.
[4656.98s -> 4657.54s]  Wow.
[4657.54s -> 4657.78s]  Yeah.
[4657.78s -> 4661.54s]  I mean, that is, that is surprising when comparing you to someone like Magos or something.
[4661.54s -> 4663.14s]  I mean, that's a, that's a really big difference.
[4664.18s -> 4664.90s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4664.90s -> 4669.38s]  No, I'm a, and I think in the past part of me has been a little bit like embarrassed
[4669.38s -> 4669.78s]  about that.
[4669.78s -> 4673.22s]  I'd be like, Oh, like these people all think I've got strong fingers.
[4674.50s -> 4680.58s]  I can't show them that I'm terrible at this, but yeah, my, uh, my, uh, passion doesn't
[4680.58s -> 4681.46s]  lie on a finger board.
[4682.42s -> 4686.58s]  I got my goals from those edges, but, um, yeah, no, I'm not.
[4688.34s -> 4690.18s]  Well, this is so interesting.
[4690.18s -> 4694.82s]  Cause I think, I think, um, between this conversation and my conversation with Dan, I'm really
[4694.82s -> 4702.18s]  starting to understand just how maybe misplaced my own, uh, understanding of my own finger
[4702.18s -> 4706.18s]  strength has been in the last like year or so, because I really, really struggle on like
[4706.18s -> 4710.34s]  a one-arm dead hang sort of thing, even on a pretty big edge, but I've been noticing
[4710.34s -> 4713.30s]  I've been paying more attention to like my grip position on an edge like that.
[4713.30s -> 4718.50s]  Like, let's take the Beastmaker center edge, whatever that is like 22, 23 millimeter and
[4718.50s -> 4724.10s]  my pinky, it's not as long as yours, but it almost ends up like kind of in, in this weird
[4724.10s -> 4730.02s]  in-between no man's land where it's not quite short enough to just drag on the edge, but
[4730.02s -> 4731.78s]  it's not long enough to crimp up on the edge.
[4731.78s -> 4736.66s]  So it kind of, it just kind of feels like it can't do a whole lot, you know, it's a
[4736.66s -> 4737.46s]  bit uncomfortable.
[4737.54s -> 4742.18s]  Yeah, it's a bit uncomfortable and it's, I'm kind of like skin catching on that, um, you
[4742.18s -> 4744.98s]  know, that dip, that crease, like right below your dip joint.
[4744.98s -> 4750.58s]  Um, but yeah, I just feel like I'm not getting much out of it, but outside, you know, I,
[4750.58s -> 4754.90s]  I boulder harder than you would think that I would based on those numbers that I get
[4754.90s -> 4759.86s]  on like a 20 mil edge or something, but this is probably why I think it's because I'm good
[4759.86s -> 4764.34s]  at like, you know, engaging individual fingers a little bit better on like a weird shaped
[4764.34s -> 4765.14s]  holder things.
[4765.70s -> 4769.94s]  And it's pretty rare that I run into that issue because, you know, you don't get a perfectly
[4769.94s -> 4773.70s]  flat rounded, comfy 23 millimeter edge outside very often.
[4773.70s -> 4776.42s]  So yeah, super interesting.
[4776.42s -> 4776.82s]  Yeah.
[4776.82s -> 4781.70s]  Usually your skin on your fingers will nestle up if you're on a jug when you're outside,
[4781.70s -> 4785.78s]  like it's quite rare that you get an edge where that is applicable.
[4785.78s -> 4792.82s]  But like you, uh, you mentioned earlier on, you grew up climbing on, um, you said on
[4792.82s -> 4798.26s]  like slightly more like vert or slabby stuff where you were on small holds, but weight
[4798.26s -> 4800.26s]  was in your, a lot of weight was in your feet.
[4801.46s -> 4806.34s]  I imagine because of that angle, the holds generally for the moves to be hard, the holds
[4806.34s -> 4808.02s]  all are probably really quite small.
[4808.58s -> 4817.14s]  And usually like if a hold is really small, you're like utilized, like you'll probably
[4817.14s -> 4819.62s]  end up crimping up on them or like, yeah, it's rare.
[4819.62s -> 4823.46s]  Like you probably don't find yourself dragging on micro edges or it's really hard to.
[4824.02s -> 4824.50s]  Yeah.
[4824.50s -> 4828.50s]  Like I'm probably pretty good at like two finger front, two crimps, you know, relative
[4828.50s -> 4831.86s]  to, to a lot of people that climb at a similar level to me.
[4831.86s -> 4833.38s]  Cause I've done a lot of that sort of stuff.
[4834.34s -> 4834.66s]  Yeah.
[4834.66s -> 4840.58s]  So you might, I didn't, um, I don't know if you, uh, will know entirely, but like it's
[4840.58s -> 4841.30s]  quite hard as well.
[4841.30s -> 4847.78s]  Cause not many people do this sling testing or like, uh, it's a lot less like measurable
[4847.86s -> 4851.14s]  when you kind of introduce the angles of people's fingers.
[4851.14s -> 4855.46s]  If you just see how much weight you can hold on this edge, people will hold the edge in
[4855.46s -> 4861.86s]  any which way they can, but like to standardize the angle at which you can like hold on something,
[4861.86s -> 4863.94s]  it's a lot harder to like control.
[4863.94s -> 4869.46s]  So there's not really so much data on like what is good, but I would anticipate if you
[4869.46s -> 4875.06s]  spent a lot of time in that style and struggled to hang on like half crimping on the edge,
[4875.62s -> 4882.02s]  that, um, chances are like, if you can climb harder than you'd expect someone with that
[4882.02s -> 4887.62s]  data to be able to, you're probably like, like be better at like that high angle crimping
[4887.62s -> 4890.90s]  or like, it would be quite interesting to see the way in which you hold the holds when
[4890.90s -> 4893.06s]  you do climb nearly a limit.
[4893.06s -> 4895.86s]  But it might be something that you're quite good at.
[4895.86s -> 4902.58s]  I think like, yeah, it is like the, just like finger boarding, like, or just like having
[4902.58s -> 4903.54s]  a fingerboard session.
[4904.18s -> 4905.62s]  There's a lot of complexity to it.
[4905.62s -> 4908.18s]  It can't just be like, Oh, I've done loads of fingerboarding.
[4908.18s -> 4909.62s]  So my fingers are getting stronger.
[4910.42s -> 4914.34s]  Uh, yeah, obviously it has to apply to how you actually then climb.
[4914.34s -> 4919.06s]  So yeah, you might also find that like, you'd have a tendency to that high angle crimping
[4919.06s -> 4924.98s]  kind of thing due to like your roots in climbing, but feel like you have inverted commas, weak
[4924.98s -> 4928.98s]  fingers because you can't hang on the edge, which is so accepted.
[4929.54s -> 4934.42s]  Uh, yeah, I'm having to point home now.
[4936.34s -> 4936.58s]  Nice.
[4937.62s -> 4938.50s]  I mean, going at it.
[4939.54s -> 4943.30s]  Um, I don't want to, I don't want to spend too much time here cause I had a whole two
[4943.30s -> 4947.54s]  hour podcast with Dan Varian about the sling test and this really geeky finger stuff.
[4947.54s -> 4951.70s]  So I want to get back to, uh, to your rock climbing.
[4951.70s -> 4953.54s]  Actually, I feel like I should close the loop on this.
[4953.54s -> 4954.82s]  I do have one more question.
[4954.82s -> 4958.74s]  When you found out that your index fingers were weak relative to your other fingers,
[4959.38s -> 4960.74s]  what did you do to address that?
[4960.74s -> 4962.34s]  Or what are you doing to address that?
[4963.86s -> 4970.10s]  I definitely, initially when I've discovered it, I was using like the mono crimping as
[4970.10s -> 4973.54s]  like a training tool, not just a testing tool.
[4973.54s -> 4977.22s]  So I did actually hammer that quite a lot, um, which did make a difference.
[4977.22s -> 4978.18s]  It was quite good.
[4978.82s -> 4983.70s]  And I'd still, I'm still a bit essentially, I think the risk of doing it is like, it can
[4983.70s -> 4987.46s]  be quite, you can be quite susceptible to injury doing it.
[4987.46s -> 4989.46s]  I think if you're really measured, it can be helpful.
[4990.18s -> 4994.50s]  Uh, so I did do that quite a lot, which I didn't notice a big difference, but, uh, I
[4994.50s -> 4999.70s]  started like essentially the way in which I'd then apply that strength was in a front
[4999.70s -> 5005.06s]  three crimp climbing without your pinky basically, uh, when holds too small to avow it.
[5005.70s -> 5008.58s]  And so that was kind of like what I want to get better at.
[5008.58s -> 5014.26s]  So I definitely initially got my fingers, I'd had quite a prolonged spell of like training
[5014.26s -> 5016.82s]  my index with a mono sling.
[5016.82s -> 5024.10s]  And that like did get them quite a lot stronger, but I feel like the familiarity of like, I
[5024.10s -> 5027.06s]  did a lot of training in like front three half crimp position.
[5027.06s -> 5029.62s]  And I'd usually do that two arms added weight.
[5029.62s -> 5038.02s]  Um, and usually my go-to has always been to use an edge as small as I can before skin becomes
[5038.02s -> 5038.90s]  a limiting factor.
[5039.46s -> 5045.70s]  Um, so generally, well, generally actually I'd use that the outside edge on the beast
[5045.70s -> 5047.38s]  maker two thousands.
[5047.38s -> 5051.62s]  Um, I think that's like 13 mil maybe for people listening, something like that.
[5051.62s -> 5052.42s]  Kind of pretty round.
[5052.42s -> 5054.34s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5054.34s -> 5055.54s]  It's kind of like, it's enough.
[5055.54s -> 5057.54s]  So it's like it's rounded enough.
[5057.54s -> 5058.66s]  So it's very comfortable.
[5058.66s -> 5063.46s]  I don't lose any skin, but like, I'm very much on like the pad of my fingers.
[5063.46s -> 5066.58s]  So I'm not like using any extra assistance.
[5067.22s -> 5072.10s]  And so I'd kind of like train in that position because it also felt very unnatural for me
[5072.10s -> 5076.90s]  to drop my pinky or like, I felt like quite exposed, like exposing your ring finger was
[5076.90s -> 5082.18s]  like, it felt quite risky for me or like, it felt very unnatural for me.
[5082.18s -> 5085.06s]  And so I was quite slow, like progressing into that.
[5085.06s -> 5090.90s]  Um, and then I also like focused quite a lot on like in that, like front free half position,
[5091.38s -> 5092.82s]  uh, not like kind of.
[5093.54s -> 5099.22s]  Uh, rotating my like thumbs towards me, um, which would like load my ring finger more
[5100.02s -> 5101.94s]  and like take load off my index.
[5101.94s -> 5104.74s]  I focused on like internally rotating my hands.
[5104.74s -> 5108.98s]  Um, so like I'd like, uh, make sure that I was like keeping weight on my index.
[5108.98s -> 5113.86s]  So like, I wasn't just using what was good to like, kind of take weight off what was weak.
[5113.86s -> 5116.50s]  Um, so I've kind of like played around with that.
[5116.50s -> 5121.54s]  Um, and I've definitely noticed a difference climbing outside as well.
[5121.54s -> 5128.02s]  Like I, at one point I'd like, I'd try everything I could to try and like nestle in fingers
[5128.02s -> 5132.58s]  and like kind of squeeze your fingers together, which can sometimes work quite well on hold,
[5132.58s -> 5138.02s]  but, um, being able to have like the front free be quite strong in a front free crimp
[5138.02s -> 5140.50s]  is like just a tool, which is good to be able to access.
[5141.14s -> 5149.30s]  Um, um, so yeah, I was like, initially to summarize initially definitely did some of
[5149.30s -> 5154.02s]  that models, mono sling training, but then once I'd done that, I kind of figured out
[5154.02s -> 5155.38s]  why I was doing that.
[5155.38s -> 5158.50s]  It was to be better in that like front free half current position.
[5158.50s -> 5163.06s]  And I guess generally just like when I'm on small holds, like if my index can take more
[5163.94s -> 5168.90s]  weight, I'm obviously going to be able to use small holds or put more force for it.
[5169.62s -> 5174.50s]  But yeah, really like it was mainly, I kind of realized that it was a glaring weakness.
[5174.50s -> 5175.70s]  I was bad in that position.
[5175.70s -> 5180.50s]  So then I trained that position and make sure I was like kind of engaging the index in that
[5180.50s -> 5180.90s]  position.
[5182.50s -> 5182.98s]  I love it.
[5182.98s -> 5186.34s]  I mean, it, it reminds me so much of talking to Dan.
[5186.98s -> 5192.66s]  It's, it's so clear to me, like how much thought you put into, you know, it's not just like
[5192.66s -> 5193.94s]  the fingerboard protocol.
[5193.94s -> 5198.50s]  It's like the sensation of how you're loading your fingers on an edge on the hangboard.
[5199.30s -> 5204.58s]  Like you were saying, if you were to train your front three and a crimp with your index
[5204.58s -> 5208.74s]  finger being the weaker finger, you could kind of torque your hands outward and load
[5208.74s -> 5212.82s]  the ring fingers more and compensate and probably hang a little bit more weight.
[5212.82s -> 5217.22s]  But what you're choosing to do is be more patient, probably be more conservative with
[5217.22s -> 5221.22s]  the load and just really focus on driving inward on those index fingers.
[5222.82s -> 5225.30s]  And it's just, yeah, it's go ahead.
[5225.30s -> 5226.02s]  Go ahead.
[5226.02s -> 5232.02s]  No, I definitely think quality is really, um, like really important when training my
[5232.02s -> 5237.30s]  fingers or like, as in like, like attention to detail and yeah.
[5237.30s -> 5241.22s]  And I think, I think it comes back to this point about like understanding why I'm doing
[5241.22s -> 5241.78s]  it as well.
[5241.78s -> 5247.06s]  Like I'm trying, I want to do it so that I'm better when I'm climbing on the rocks.
[5247.06s -> 5250.82s]  Um, or like my goals lie in rock climbing.
[5250.82s -> 5256.10s]  And so like my training feels like it ought to be adapted for that.
[5256.10s -> 5262.50s]  And so generally, like if I really know what I need to do to be able to like what I need
[5262.50s -> 5267.86s]  to work on to be better at that, or like the training is like, it's a means to an end.
[5267.86s -> 5271.62s]  And so I'll do it in like the quality way, which will translate best.
[5271.62s -> 5277.78s]  So I'd much rather have a little bit weight, less weight attached to my waist, but be
[5277.86s -> 5284.98s]  holding the edge in like a position, which is applicable then to be able to hold it
[5284.98s -> 5289.22s]  suboptimally, but for a little more weight on, um, it's just less useful.
[5291.22s -> 5292.26s]  That's awesome.
[5292.26s -> 5292.50s]  Yeah.
[5292.50s -> 5295.62s]  And for people listening, if you're going to go do any sort of monocrimp training,
[5296.26s -> 5297.22s]  please be careful.
[5297.22s -> 5300.82s]  Please just be patient and start really, really light and easier way in.
[5300.90s -> 5308.10s]  It does put a weird strain on the lumbar coals and just, it just feels sketchy if you've
[5308.10s -> 5308.82s]  never done it before.
[5308.82s -> 5311.22s]  And it probably is sketchy if you've never done it before.
[5311.22s -> 5317.46s]  So I think the takeaway there is just start slow, just start really light and take tons
[5317.46s -> 5321.06s]  and tons of time if you're going to try to build up any sort of load.
[5322.98s -> 5328.98s]  Sadly for listeners, there is no rapid magic formula for finger strength.
[5328.98s -> 5334.26s]  And so if you do try something new, you want to go slow.
[5334.26s -> 5338.34s]  The biggest thing that will impede your progress is if you get injured.
[5338.34s -> 5340.50s]  So you're better off taking it a bit slower.
[5341.54s -> 5346.42s]  But yeah, no matter what you do, you're not going to solve the issue of weak fingers overnight.
[5348.02s -> 5348.42s]  All right.
[5348.42s -> 5355.54s]  So let's take this philosophy that you have of quality and applicability.
[5355.54s -> 5360.66s]  And I want to hear how you're thinking about that with approaching your training for Alfvén.
[5361.22s -> 5362.42s]  Can you give me some examples?
[5362.42s -> 5366.02s]  Like what are some things that you're focusing on for this training block?
[5367.14s -> 5371.14s]  You know, that are very, I guess, let's just go back to the start of the conversation with
[5371.14s -> 5372.02s]  those bullet points.
[5372.02s -> 5375.38s]  Like what are a few of the things that you noticed when you were trying the boulder this
[5375.38s -> 5375.70s]  spring?
[5376.50s -> 5380.18s]  What are some of the bullet points that you made notes of and how are you addressing those
[5380.18s -> 5381.22s]  in your current training?
[5381.78s -> 5382.34s]  Yeah.
[5382.34s -> 5391.30s]  So lots of the attention to detail I have when I approach a climb, I kind of adopted
[5391.30s -> 5396.58s]  that strategy or that approach to it a lot from in my younger years climbing with Dan.
[5396.58s -> 5401.94s]  So he has quite a similar analytical approach to projecting a climb.
[5401.94s -> 5408.26s]  And what that usually consists of is when we're figuring out a move, we'll be quite
[5409.22s -> 5413.38s]  switched on to what feels as though has gone wrong.
[5413.38s -> 5421.30s]  And we'll be quite experimental about other options, like whether, well, okay, for simplicity
[5421.30s -> 5429.06s]  sake, say we've tried all options and we've figured out that this is probably the best
[5429.06s -> 5430.34s]  holds to use or something.
[5431.38s -> 5436.26s]  So obviously we'll try all the other options of hold sequences.
[5436.26s -> 5437.62s]  This is approaching a new climb.
[5438.82s -> 5444.66s]  But when it's just a case of doing a move, where something to go wrong, we'll be quite
[5444.66s -> 5446.98s]  thoughtful as to what has gone wrong.
[5446.98s -> 5453.54s]  And we'll be quite experimental in trying new options, but be quite calculated in when
[5453.54s -> 5456.02s]  we try something new, be aware of what we're trying.
[5456.58s -> 5462.18s]  And so when you stumble across, generally you'll try a few things and you'll have an
[5462.26s -> 5467.54s]  inkling of like, it will be like an educated, it won't just be a shot in the dark as to
[5468.50s -> 5471.46s]  now I'll try rotate my ankle this way or whatever.
[5471.46s -> 5475.62s]  Like it will be like, usually this is a kind of formula which works.
[5475.62s -> 5478.34s]  And like, maybe this will apply well to this.
[5478.98s -> 5484.74s]  So when we do a move, when we like do something which works well, it would be like, that would
[5484.74s -> 5487.30s]  be like a little detail of that move to remember.
[5487.30s -> 5492.34s]  And usually you end up with a collection of these for each move of like things which
[5492.34s -> 5499.38s]  work and things which you often like once you've committed to a sequence on a particular
[5499.38s -> 5504.66s]  set of moves, you'll understand what generally is the limiting factor of that move.
[5504.66s -> 5507.46s]  So perhaps where you have to like apply your focus.
[5508.02s -> 5515.14s]  And usually when I was talking about bullet points, I usually have a collection of these
[5515.14s -> 5519.46s]  things about each move and I try to make it as simple as possible.
[5519.46s -> 5525.94s]  So like it might come down to, I love like learn maybe like a handful of details about
[5525.94s -> 5532.74s]  a move, but I don't want to remember 10 details about a 15 move problem and 10 details about
[5532.74s -> 5533.46s]  every move.
[5533.46s -> 5536.58s]  Cause I'll just be like, it'll be a crazy memory game.
[5536.58s -> 5541.54s]  And I want to be able to like, I don't want to have to think about all of the things to
[5541.54s -> 5542.58s]  remember for the next move.
[5542.58s -> 5547.46s]  So often I will try and like condense them down to like the most limiting factor.
[5547.46s -> 5553.38s]  So it might just be like, well, I know that if I think to myself to keep pressure in that
[5553.38s -> 5556.42s]  foot, likely these other things are going to work as well.
[5557.22s -> 5559.86s]  And I kind of know what feels right in that position.
[5559.86s -> 5561.70s]  And usually it's a foot that blows.
[5561.70s -> 5565.22s]  So like that's my little like bullet point for this move.
[5565.22s -> 5567.22s]  And I usually end up with a list of these things.
[5568.18s -> 5569.22s]  Is this a physical list?
[5569.22s -> 5570.34s]  Do you write this stuff down?
[5571.30s -> 5580.02s]  No, usually it's kind of just tucked away in the noggin, but I have done it before where
[5580.02s -> 5580.90s]  I've written things down.
[5582.50s -> 5587.30s]  I guess it's helpful if you go away from Boulder and come back.
[5588.26s -> 5593.14s]  I definitely, I wrote, I had have written some things down for Alfvén cause I like
[5593.14s -> 5595.70s]  kind of learned it pretty well and then left it.
[5596.98s -> 5599.14s]  But most of them, actually, I haven't found myself.
[5599.54s -> 5600.66s]  I had to refer to a list.
[5601.22s -> 5603.30s]  I've kind of remembered them quite well.
[5604.02s -> 5610.34s]  Anyway, but essentially all of this, like kind of these quite precise points, which
[5610.34s -> 5613.94s]  I'd made in my head were definitely quite helpful when I was setting my replica because
[5614.82s -> 5618.58s]  I knew what were the things that would go wrong and like what I usually did in the
[5618.58s -> 5624.26s]  positions, which can be quite subtle, but felt necessary for me to do the moves.
[5624.34s -> 5629.62s]  And so if I can replicate those, then I know the moves are probably somewhat quite
[5629.62s -> 5630.98s]  helpful to practice.
[5632.50s -> 5637.78s]  So that was kind of like that kind of like approach to detail.
[5637.78s -> 5639.14s]  It's always felt quite useful.
[5639.14s -> 5641.46s]  It feels like it really reduces any random error.
[5642.66s -> 5650.66s]  And especially like often when you're projecting or like giving really attempts like on
[5650.66s -> 5655.62s]  something really hard for you outside, usually you don't have that many goes.
[5656.34s -> 5658.90s]  In the example of Alfvén, it's quite long.
[5658.90s -> 5663.38s]  And I mean, when I first tried it, it was like the end of Sean's process on it.
[5663.38s -> 5666.58s]  And he was having like two, maybe three goes a day.
[5667.46s -> 5668.74s]  So you get very few goes.
[5669.46s -> 5673.94s]  So like reducing random error, it's really helpful because I don't know, you don't
[5673.94s -> 5676.42s]  want to like foot to pop on the last hard move.
[5676.74s -> 5683.22s]  And then often like that's quite a rare example where skin usually isn't an issue.
[5683.22s -> 5687.70s]  And usually you can't just like burn through a load of attempts because you usually got
[5687.70s -> 5693.38s]  limiting factors down to like, yeah, skin or other things out of your control.
[5693.38s -> 5700.02s]  So generally attempts really matter when you're right at your limit.
[5700.02s -> 5706.18s]  And so to control everything that you can feels quite helpful for me.
[5706.18s -> 5708.82s]  And it extends to like the intricacies of the move as well.
[5708.82s -> 5713.38s]  Like it's kind of like a bit of a ritual for me, but I don't know how much it is actually
[5713.38s -> 5720.34s]  like I don't necessarily think all of it is entirely like physically helpful, but like
[5720.34s -> 5724.26s]  I'm usually quite like before I'd have an attempt, I'd be quite careful of like
[5725.14s -> 5730.42s]  cleaning a hold, but like not too much, like, especially like on granite as well.
[5730.42s -> 5732.58s]  It's like a hold has no chalk in it.
[5732.58s -> 5734.90s]  It can be like a little bit slippier.
[5734.90s -> 5738.50s]  And like, I'll go through the process of cleaning the holes, cleaning my shoes, kind
[5738.50s -> 5740.74s]  of like making sure the landing's all good.
[5740.74s -> 5744.74s]  And like, it was like kind of all these things to set on my mind to like, so that when I
[5744.74s -> 5748.10s]  pull on, I can be like content that everything I could have controlled that I have.
[5750.66s -> 5752.50s]  I find that gives me some peace of mind.
[5752.50s -> 5759.86s]  And I think it's also like a little way in which I can access some like, it's almost
[5759.86s -> 5765.06s]  like a mechanism for me to kind of access like the state I feel like I usually need
[5765.06s -> 5767.94s]  to be in to try my hardest.
[5770.42s -> 5771.78s]  And we will be right back.
[5773.46s -> 5776.58s]  This episode is brought to you by Frictitious Climbing.
[5776.58s -> 5781.46s]  Today, I want to tell you about my two favorite products from Frictitious.
[5781.46s -> 5785.22s]  First up is the EZ Board, spelled E-Z Board.
[5785.22s -> 5788.18s]  It's hands down the most versatile hangboard I have ever seen.
[5788.18s -> 5792.42s]  It's portable, meaning you can take this thing to the crag and hang it from a tree
[5792.42s -> 5794.26s]  or from a bolt at the sport cliff.
[5794.82s -> 5798.74s]  But what makes the EZ Board unique is that it comes with a mounting plate that allows
[5798.74s -> 5801.14s]  it to be used as a traditional hangboard.
[5801.14s -> 5806.02s]  In just a few seconds, you can mount it above your doorway at home in any of four different
[5806.02s -> 5809.62s]  orientations and use it just like a regular hangboard.
[5809.62s -> 5814.26s]  It's light, it's compact, and it covers all your bases.
[5814.26s -> 5814.90s]  It's awesome.
[5814.90s -> 5815.70s]  Check it out.
[5815.70s -> 5818.18s]  Second is the Hangboard Doorway Mount.
[5818.74s -> 5822.90s]  The Hangboard Doorway Mount is perfect for climbers who don't have a great spot for a
[5822.90s -> 5826.58s]  hangboard at home or who can't drill into their wall.
[5826.58s -> 5830.90s]  It's a great way to train in your home or apartment, and you can even have Frictitious
[5830.90s -> 5835.70s]  install one of their hangboards for you so when it arrives, you can be up and training
[5835.70s -> 5836.58s]  in minutes.
[5837.14s -> 5837.86s]  This thing's awesome.
[5837.86s -> 5843.54s]  It's super easy to set up, it's bomber, and it's rock solid even if you have weight added
[5843.54s -> 5845.54s]  to you when you're hangboarding.
[5845.62s -> 5846.18s]  So check it out.

[5863.14s -> 5865.78s]  This episode is also brought to you by PEDSOL.
[5865.78s -> 5868.50s]  Today, I want to talk about harnesses.
[5868.50s -> 5872.10s]  When it comes to harnesses, comfort can mean a lot of different things.
[5872.10s -> 5877.30s]  Sometimes you want a harness for hard red points or light and fast adventures, and on
[5877.30s -> 5881.38s]  other days, you might need something for long belays and multiple repels.
[5881.38s -> 5883.22s]  There's no such thing as a perfect harness.
[5883.22s -> 5888.18s]  The perfect harness is the one that's perfect for you, and you probably do a lot of different
[5888.18s -> 5888.58s]  stuff.
[5889.14s -> 5894.34s]  That's why PEDSOL builds harnesses for gym climbing, cragging, and alpine adventures
[5894.34s -> 5897.06s]  using four unique constructions.
[5897.06s -> 5902.02s]  Frame construction has the traditional fit, comfort levels, and safety features climbers
[5902.02s -> 5903.06s]  are used to.
[5903.06s -> 5906.50s]  Endo frame construction provides flexibility and cushion.
[5906.50s -> 5912.10s]  Fuse frame construction is streamlined yet supportive, and wire frame construction harnesses
[5912.10s -> 5914.50s]  are breathable and ultra lightweight.
[5914.50s -> 5920.02s]  So, whether you want lightweight performance or plush comfort, PEDSOL harnesses have you
[5920.02s -> 5920.42s]  covered.
[5920.98s -> 5925.94s]  To learn more about PEDSOL harnesses, visit your local retailer or PEDSOL's website at
[5925.94s -> 5927.46s]  PEDSOL.com.
[5927.46s -> 5932.02s]  Again, you can learn more and shop for PEDSOL harnesses at your local climbing shop or online
[5932.02s -> 5933.30s]  at PEDSOL.com.
[5933.94s -> 5936.50s]  Experience the difference with PEDSOL.
[5938.58s -> 5939.94s]  And now, back to the show.
[5942.98s -> 5948.10s]  In setting up your replica, can you give me more examples of how you implemented some
[5948.10s -> 5949.06s]  of these bullet points?
[5949.30s -> 5954.42s]  Maybe you can describe some of the hardest specific moves and what you were thinking
[5954.42s -> 5955.86s]  about when you set those on your board.
[5956.58s -> 5962.82s]  Yeah, so I guess it's not easy for many climbs because the holds...
[5965.78s -> 5966.66s]  I'm quite fortunate.
[5966.66s -> 5971.22s]  I've got a home board and most of my holds are wooden, and I quite like wood carving,
[5972.10s -> 5975.06s]  so I do quite a lot of that, and so I can adapt the holds.
[5975.86s -> 5977.54s]  I do that for quite a few of my holds.
[5978.26s -> 5981.54s]  You shape them to be more similar to the actual holds on the rock.
[5982.42s -> 5983.54s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5983.54s -> 5985.94s]  So I would carve some of them.
[5985.94s -> 5987.06s]  If there's some obvious...
[5988.10s -> 5992.82s]  There's one hold on Alfvén, which you're back free on one edge, and you're back free
[5992.82s -> 5997.70s]  on an edge slightly above where your index is, and so it spits your hand a little bit,
[5997.70s -> 6000.90s]  and so I could hand carve that into a hold, which...
[6001.54s -> 6005.54s]  I mean, no hold manufacturer would ever want to make that because it's objectively slightly
[6005.54s -> 6006.10s]  uncomfortable.
[6007.70s -> 6008.50s]  Right, right, right.
[6009.62s -> 6014.66s]  So that's quite helpful, and that's usually where I start making holds which feel similar.
[6015.46s -> 6021.38s]  Obviously, the angle is slightly different, and so you have to take that into account.
[6021.38s -> 6026.98s]  The holds obviously have to be worse, but I'm more trying to generate the positions.
[6026.98s -> 6030.42s]  So usually when I'm setting a replica, I measure the positions between the holds.
[6030.42s -> 6032.42s]  I didn't actually do that with Alfvén.
[6032.42s -> 6037.06s]  I didn't really intend on setting a replica originally, but I got quite into it.
[6038.10s -> 6039.38s]  Just the concept of it.
[6039.38s -> 6040.58s]  It's really fun.
[6040.58s -> 6041.94s]  How would you do that?
[6041.94s -> 6043.54s]  What tools are you using to do that?
[6045.62s -> 6050.58s]  So I use a measuring tape because I don't entirely trust it, but you can do that on
[6050.58s -> 6051.54s]  phones these days.
[6051.54s -> 6057.22s]  You can use a measuring app and measure between the holds, or the way I actually scan the
[6057.22s -> 6063.70s]  holds with Burden of Dreams, I used an app called Polycam, which you can LiDAR the whole
[6063.70s -> 6065.62s]  boulder, and that's got a measuring tool.
[6066.42s -> 6072.50s]  But I was a bit skeptical of it, so I measured it independently of that, but it actually
[6072.50s -> 6073.30s]  was about right.
[6073.30s -> 6075.70s]  So I eat my hat.
[6075.70s -> 6077.30s]  Technology's not so bad these days.
[6083.62s -> 6090.50s]  Yeah, no, so I would like, usually that's how I'd approach the distances between the
[6090.50s -> 6093.38s]  holds are obviously kind of the place to start.
[6093.38s -> 6100.18s]  I'd make sure the holds feel similar, but the feeling of the moves, that's all pretty
[6100.18s -> 6100.90s]  guessworky.
[6101.46s -> 6105.46s]  Essentially, the thing I really focus on is trying moves a lot.
[6105.46s -> 6111.06s]  Hard moves, you often fall off them, and I kind of really began to understand what the
[6111.06s -> 6117.38s]  things that go wrong, what were the things that would go wrong, or what would be generally
[6117.38s -> 6120.50s]  the theme of things which would inhibit me doing that move.
[6121.14s -> 6125.38s]  And so I try and recreate that in the moves that I set.
[6125.38s -> 6129.54s]  So generally, it's a lot of setting it, tweaking it, setting it, tweaking it.
[6131.14s -> 6134.74s]  And I actually, it didn't take too many tweaks to do this one.
[6134.74s -> 6140.66s]  Maybe I'm getting a bit better at setting replicas these days, but it's a lot of
[6140.66s -> 6141.78s]  experimentation.
[6141.78s -> 6146.18s]  And I actually think there's value in, so I've got the main replica which I climb on,
[6146.18s -> 6156.98s]  which has the specific carved holds and feels like the most applicable to the climb.
[6157.54s -> 6162.50s]  But then I have three options for every hand, basically, and the same three options for
[6162.50s -> 6163.06s]  every feet.
[6163.62s -> 6167.78s]  So I will do the main, mostly work on the main one.
[6167.78s -> 6172.34s]  But then I'll try all the different little variations as well, which don't feel quite
[6172.34s -> 6173.14s]  the same.
[6173.14s -> 6180.82s]  But basically, I don't want to get really specifically recruited at my replica, which
[6180.82s -> 6184.34s]  is very similar, but not exactly the same.
[6184.34s -> 6189.46s]  I think it's quite good to be quite well-trained in all the slight variations of it as well.
[6190.82s -> 6196.02s]  So I definitely experiment a bit, but it was a lot of tweaking.
[6196.02s -> 6201.30s]  And so an example of the move, actually, an example of the move, it'd be hard to describe
[6201.30s -> 6202.82s]  where it is in the sequence.
[6202.82s -> 6208.42s]  There's basically one section on Alfvén, where most people who were trying it were
[6209.06s -> 6214.34s]  kind of, you get like a big, open, like rounded slot with your left hand.
[6214.34s -> 6219.46s]  And most people here were like kind of cutting and moving their feet to the left, and then
[6220.34s -> 6225.14s]  matching into a crimp next to the left hand, and then moving their feet back to the right,
[6225.14s -> 6226.34s]  and then going up again.
[6226.98s -> 6231.54s]  And at this point here, I actually don't move my feet to the left at all.
[6231.54s -> 6235.54s]  I keep my feet on the right and like extend straight up.
[6235.54s -> 6240.02s]  So I don't use the intermediate, I extend straight up to like this, which is this weird
[6240.02s -> 6243.86s]  split crimp with the lower index in the back three I was talking about.
[6243.86s -> 6251.86s]  And basically what that does is it reduces a bunch of foot moves, it's a bit quicker,
[6252.42s -> 6256.82s]  but it suits me way better in that like, I basically hold the open handed slot with
[6256.82s -> 6263.54s]  four fingers, slightly flexed, and I like keep weight in a foot far away, which like,
[6263.54s -> 6266.82s]  and I go, I go pretty statically, it's like a lock for me.
[6267.78s -> 6271.06s]  And it's like a thing that like definitely suits me quite well.
[6271.06s -> 6276.66s]  But like, there were like certain details of that, like, I know that I place my right
[6276.66s -> 6280.74s]  foot, I draw my left foot into an undercut, and then I always readjust my right foot and
[6280.74s -> 6283.06s]  slightly turn my like right knee inwards.
[6283.70s -> 6288.98s]  And basically, I just played around with this replica and the foothold that I was using
[6288.98s -> 6291.86s]  until like, that felt like the only way that I could do the move.
[6293.70s -> 6298.26s]  And then I knew that that was kind of like, good enough to be like training the right
[6298.26s -> 6298.50s]  stuff.
[6300.18s -> 6307.86s]  But in terms of like, how I've prepared for Alfvén in general, it's actually like, the
[6307.86s -> 6312.66s]  thing that's most like, most general, like strength, muscle group that I've trained to
[6312.66s -> 6315.06s]  be specific for is actually mostly in the legs.
[6316.82s -> 6318.42s]  I use my adductors loads on it.
[6319.86s -> 6322.26s]  Which I mean, legs are really underrated in climbing actually.
[6323.46s -> 6325.38s]  I use my legs loads when I'm climbing.
[6327.06s -> 6331.22s]  But the way I definitely climb it, it's a lot of compression with my legs.
[6332.42s -> 6335.70s]  And so I have been doing quite a bit of specific training for that.
[6336.50s -> 6338.66s]  Which has felt quite helpful.
[6338.66s -> 6339.78s]  We'll see how it goes.
[6339.78s -> 6340.66s]  Is that on the wall?
[6340.66s -> 6345.38s]  Is that making up movements that kind of simulate that leg squeezing on the wall or
[6345.38s -> 6347.46s]  with supplemental exercises as well?
[6348.50s -> 6350.02s]  Supplemental exercise as well.
[6351.94s -> 6356.50s]  So Oli kind of does, Oli Tour sets my training plan.
[6357.78s -> 6362.66s]  And we usually like, are quite experimental with the sessions we will have.
[6362.66s -> 6365.46s]  And we're like, trial period set.
[6365.46s -> 6367.62s]  And I'll kind of feedback what works well.
[6367.62s -> 6373.62s]  And one of the things which did feel quite useful was, I don't know if you know, do you
[6373.62s -> 6376.58s]  know what a Copenhagen plank is?
[6376.58s -> 6377.78s]  No, Copenhagen plank.
[6377.78s -> 6378.50s]  I've never heard of that.
[6379.22s -> 6380.98s]  It's essentially like a side plank.
[6381.86s -> 6386.18s]  So say if your right elbow was on the floor and you're doing a side plank, but your feet
[6386.18s -> 6392.10s]  were on a chair, if your right elbow was down, your left toe would be on the chair, but your
[6392.10s -> 6393.94s]  right toe would be hanging underneath.
[6393.94s -> 6398.34s]  So you're essentially like, the difficulty is holding your legs together.
[6400.34s -> 6402.82s]  I will essentially do, so that's on a chair.
[6402.82s -> 6407.30s]  I'll actually do that on a climbing wall with my foot on a foothold so that my ankle becomes
[6407.30s -> 6410.90s]  like an extra, like it's like an extra point to fail.
[6411.78s -> 6417.78s]  And so like your calves are really like engaged and like, I will vary like my knee length
[6417.78s -> 6419.94s]  is quite a funky exercise.
[6419.94s -> 6428.50s]  But I find that would like really like hammer my adductors and felt like it gives me a
[6428.50s -> 6431.78s]  lot more stability when I'm like compressing with my legs anyway.
[6431.78s -> 6432.42s]  Wow.
[6432.42s -> 6433.54s]  That's so cool, man.
[6433.54s -> 6437.78s]  I've never even thought to do anything like that, but it makes perfect sense.
[6437.78s -> 6438.34s]  That's awesome.
[6439.54s -> 6444.98s]  Yeah, it's a lot of, I quite like this kind of like, I think this is something that I
[6444.98s -> 6447.38s]  would never have quite gotten in competition.
[6447.38s -> 6449.94s]  Obviously like you do.
[6449.94s -> 6455.78s]  I mean, I'm friends with a few competitors and it's crazy the amount of volume they do,
[6455.78s -> 6459.06s]  but like this level of specificity, I kind of quite, I enjoy it.
[6459.06s -> 6466.34s]  It's quite, it's quite fun to be like, so, well, yeah, it requires a lot of trial and
[6466.34s -> 6469.54s]  error, but yeah, it's fun to go so detailed with it.
[6469.78s -> 6476.66s]  Um, I also do another exercise I do on wall quite a lot, which I do find helpful.
[6477.38s -> 6483.46s]  Um, is I have like, just on my board, I have like a set of just like really good kind of
[6483.46s -> 6488.98s]  open holds and I'll actually just keep my hands on those and do like sequences with
[6488.98s -> 6489.78s]  my feet.
[6489.78s -> 6495.70s]  Um, so that's kind of like a bit more like I'll get very extended and, and I kind of
[6495.70s -> 6498.90s]  get like the foot holds will be like kinked at angles.
[6498.90s -> 6504.10s]  That's actually one thing which I think has constituted a lot of like my style or like
[6504.10s -> 6510.82s]  kind of left me contributed to why I like that style is my board has always been like
[6510.82s -> 6511.86s]  feet follow.
[6511.86s -> 6517.46s]  So I'd have like set foot holds at the bottom, but I always stand on my hand holds, which
[6517.46s -> 6518.50s]  lots of people don't like.
[6518.50s -> 6523.94s]  I mean, if you go to like Ned's board or something, you won't see any rubber on the
[6524.66s -> 6528.90s]  it's like immaculate is board and it's not nice to have like rubber on your hand holds,
[6528.90s -> 6531.30s]  but I can sleep at night.
[6533.62s -> 6536.26s]  And, uh, and, uh, I find it really useful.
[6536.26s -> 6540.90s]  Like, and it's very, it's like, cause you then engage body tension in quite weird positions.
[6540.90s -> 6544.18s]  It's not always just like a convenient foot, wherever you want it.
[6544.18s -> 6546.98s]  So, um, I've definitely found that really helpful.
[6547.62s -> 6550.74s]  Um, but it makes me, yeah, my board is a bit less pretty.
[6550.90s -> 6557.86s]  Um, but, uh, yeah, no, I definitely find for this climb.
[6557.86s -> 6562.90s]  It's, it's not really that it's lower body or upper body is like everything is engaged
[6562.90s -> 6563.70s]  the whole time.
[6563.70s -> 6571.22s]  So like I actually incorporate breaths into my, like, um, into my sequence, um, just because
[6571.78s -> 6576.42s]  it's quite hard to breathe because you're like, your body's tense the whole time.
[6576.42s -> 6580.42s]  And like the transitions between the moves, like you can't relax at all.
[6580.42s -> 6586.90s]  So, um, I've done a lot of like, just connections between my body to like my hands and my feet.
[6586.90s -> 6592.10s]  Like I've done a lot of work to like try and maintain some control that, which has always
[6592.10s -> 6593.94s]  been something I've been okay at.
[6593.94s -> 6598.90s]  Um, but I think it's really helpful for this climb, especially.
[6599.46s -> 6600.26s]  That last comment.
[6600.26s -> 6600.82s]  So interesting.
[6600.82s -> 6604.10s]  Cause I was watching that video this morning and watching Sean climb the thing.
[6604.74s -> 6607.38s]  And I just had the thought, like, how is he getting enough oxygen?
[6607.38s -> 6610.90s]  Cause you can just barely hear him taking these tiny little sips of air, you know,
[6610.90s -> 6616.02s]  he's like, just these tiny little sips, you know, every third move or something.
[6616.02s -> 6622.74s]  And I'm just like, damn, how is he not just like beet red in the face, you know, but, um.
[6623.62s -> 6625.22s]  And in precious feet, yeah.
[6625.22s -> 6626.66s]  Lung capacities.
[6626.66s -> 6627.14s]  Yeah.
[6627.14s -> 6627.78s]  Yeah.
[6627.78s -> 6630.90s]  Well, and that kind of gets to another question that I had for you.
[6630.90s -> 6634.34s]  And actually this is very poignant for, for me right now.
[6634.42s -> 6639.94s]  Um, I have one client that I coach, um, and I'm trying to help him work on this boulder
[6639.94s -> 6642.82s]  problem that he has this fall and, you know, shout out to Neil.
[6642.82s -> 6647.14s]  Um, I think he's got a really good shot at doing it and he mostly trains on the tension
[6647.14s -> 6652.18s]  board and that's worked really well for him to just improve his, his overall strength
[6652.18s -> 6652.90s]  and his movement.
[6652.90s -> 6657.94s]  And, but this is a much longer boulder problem than you would typically have on a board like
[6657.94s -> 6658.18s]  that.
[6658.18s -> 6662.66s]  So we had a conversation the other day about whether it was better to try to do linked
[6662.66s -> 6668.18s]  up boulder problems to try to be on the wall for a similar length of time, or rather to
[6668.18s -> 6674.18s]  just do kind of these bouldering doubles where the intensity is a little bit more appropriate
[6674.18s -> 6675.54s]  or a little higher.
[6675.54s -> 6677.54s]  And he's just doing two boulders back to back.
[6678.18s -> 6683.54s]  And when you said you set a replica for Alfvén on your board, I mean, you have a decent size
[6683.54s -> 6685.54s]  home board, but it's Alfvén.
[6685.54s -> 6686.98s]  I mean, how many moves is Alfvén?
[6686.98s -> 6687.86s]  It looks massive.
[6689.06s -> 6689.38s]  Yeah.
[6689.38s -> 6691.54s]  Alfvén's a funny one.
[6691.54s -> 6692.42s]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[6694.18s -> 6699.22s]  So I actually only replicated the crux, which is like basically from when you pull on to
[6699.78s -> 6703.62s]  when you put in a left heel toe jam, which is like eight moves in or something.
[6705.06s -> 6709.22s]  It feels really long because you're under tension the whole time and it's quite slow.
[6710.74s -> 6713.62s]  But the actual hard climbing isn't a crazy long boulder.
[6713.62s -> 6715.70s]  I think it is like eight moves and a foot move.
[6716.26s -> 6718.82s]  So like, it's not so bad to replicate as hard.
[6718.82s -> 6724.58s]  I don't have like at the bottom of Alfvén, you put in like a heel toe off a sloper to
[6724.58s -> 6728.82s]  establish into an undercut and you can't, it's really hard to set that on a board.
[6728.82s -> 6730.82s]  So I don't actually have that on my replica at all.
[6731.54s -> 6736.02s]  I just like I'm pulling on from like kind of establishing into the undercut.
[6736.58s -> 6741.94s]  So I'm hoping that I can like relearn that when I actually get there.
[6742.66s -> 6747.78s]  And likewise with the top section, the top section is about 70 plus, but felt relatively
[6747.78s -> 6748.34s]  reliable.
[6748.34s -> 6752.10s]  I think probably a bit harder when you're pumped, but I did actually, I did it from
[6753.62s -> 6755.78s]  relatively early on, actually trying it.
[6755.78s -> 6759.54s]  I did it from two moves in and like topped out.
[6760.18s -> 6762.26s]  You did the whole, you did the boulder from two moves in.
[6763.62s -> 6764.02s]  Yeah.
[6764.02s -> 6764.26s]  Yeah.
[6764.26s -> 6769.22s]  The, from like the kind of the first movie, like kind of roll, it's quite an easy move
[6769.22s -> 6770.18s]  into a crimp.
[6770.18s -> 6775.06s]  And then it's quite like a, it's actually not, it's like kind of a bit of like a weird, like
[6775.06s -> 6776.66s]  squirmy move into the undercut.
[6776.66s -> 6780.90s]  And then you walk the feet and then you do like the hard, like, so I did it from like
[6780.90s -> 6784.02s]  the undercut and the crimp to the top.
[6784.02s -> 6784.58s]  Yeah.
[6784.58s -> 6785.38s]  Wow.
[6785.38s -> 6786.66s]  How, I mean, how hard was that?
[6786.66s -> 6788.02s]  Is that like V16 or something?
[6788.02s -> 6788.90s]  Just making that link?
[6790.50s -> 6793.94s]  Uh, yeah, I think that would probably be, yeah, it'd probably be around there.
[6793.94s -> 6794.44s]  Wow.
[6795.86s -> 6799.22s]  No, I think, yeah, I think like, it was funny.
[6799.22s -> 6803.30s]  I thought when I did that, I was like, oh, like the first two moves aren't really, they're
[6803.30s -> 6803.94s]  not that bad.
[6804.66s -> 6806.50s]  I was like, oh, like it'll be fine.
[6806.50s -> 6813.14s]  Like it felt like I, I was almost there, but it's, I think definitely the time is quite
[6813.14s -> 6815.54s]  slow those first couple of moves and you do a lot of foot moves.
[6815.54s -> 6820.18s]  So I think it, I think it builds, the time catches up with you quite quickly.
[6820.18s -> 6820.50s]  Gosh.
[6820.50s -> 6827.62s]  And it did feel like it added a lot, um, going from the start, um, as opposed to that.
[6828.90s -> 6832.90s]  But yeah, no, I think essentially I just replicated like the crook section.
[6833.46s -> 6840.18s]  And so hoping that the first couple of moves and like the top out, I can re-learn when
[6840.18s -> 6845.54s]  I'm there and like kind of hopefully are reliable enough that they shouldn't be a limiting
[6845.54s -> 6846.02s]  factor.
[6846.02s -> 6850.02s]  I mean, if I can get the middle section relatively reliable, I'm in a good place.
[6850.58s -> 6855.94s]  I mean, it's not perfect, but, um, it's nice to do some of the, some of the figuring out
[6855.94s -> 6859.38s]  process under the climb as well, and not in my dusty stable.
[6859.54s -> 6867.38s]  But, uh, yeah, with your, with your client, um, uh, were you toying up whether to do
[6867.38s -> 6872.26s]  like longer boulders, which incorporate down climbing or boulder doubles?
[6872.26s -> 6873.78s]  Was that your conundrum?
[6873.78s -> 6874.90s]  Yeah, exactly.
[6874.90s -> 6875.38s]  Exactly.
[6875.38s -> 6880.98s]  And we kind of landed on doing more boulder doubles and just giving him a really good
[6880.98s -> 6886.74s]  way to progress the difficulty of those by, you know, maybe first improve or increasing
[6886.82s -> 6891.54s]  the intensity of the two boulders, but then reducing the rest time between, but I just
[6891.54s -> 6892.50s]  think it's really interesting.
[6892.50s -> 6895.86s]  Like I, you know, it kind of goes back to some of the reading I've done and other climbing
[6895.86s -> 6901.62s]  coaches have talked about in running where, you know, a lot of sprinters have shifted
[6901.62s -> 6906.58s]  a lot of their training towards doing shorter blocks of really high intensity sprints.
[6906.58s -> 6911.86s]  You know, um, like Charlie Francis training, his 100 meter athletes doing sets of 40 meter
[6911.86s -> 6914.34s]  sprints to just work on their top, top power.
[6914.98s -> 6918.90s]  And they're hardly doing any 100 meter sprints until they show up for the race.
[6918.90s -> 6920.50s]  So I've kind of been thinking about that.
[6920.50s -> 6927.30s]  And in this context, like, does it actually, like, how important is it to have some practice
[6927.30s -> 6930.82s]  being on the wall for the same length of time that you're going to be on the wall for this
[6930.82s -> 6936.66s]  end versus maybe it's just, maybe it works even better, or at least as well to do what
[6936.66s -> 6940.98s]  you're doing, which is just focused more kind of in the strength zone on the shorter section
[6940.98s -> 6946.50s]  of the boulder that's really hard and just not really worry about linking all 20 moves
[6946.50s -> 6948.34s]  together or however many there are.
[6949.06s -> 6950.42s]  But yeah, what are your thoughts on that?
[6950.42s -> 6956.58s]  Do you try to do any training that's the same length of time, total time under tension that
[6956.58s -> 6958.02s]  you're going to need to send this thing?
[6958.02s -> 6963.78s]  Or is it just really making the pieces of it a little bit easier so you have a bigger
[6963.78s -> 6967.46s]  margin and then trusting that you're going to be able to link it all together when you
[6967.46s -> 6967.70s]  send?
[6968.58s -> 6972.82s]  Yeah, I think the latter point you make is probably how I've generally approaching in
[6972.82s -> 6973.30s]  the past.
[6973.30s -> 6978.90s]  Like I've usually focused a lot more on the strength side of things to the point where
[6978.90s -> 6981.06s]  like it feels easier.
[6981.06s -> 6988.98s]  And so I have a bit more room to work with for like, I mean, I wouldn't say myself.
[6988.98s -> 6992.10s]  I'm a very credible source for how to perform well on long boulders.
[6992.82s -> 6996.82s]  Generally, the boulders that I have done have been quite short in the past.
[6998.18s -> 7001.46s]  And so I'm relatively new to the long boulder game.
[7003.06s -> 7008.26s]  But I definitely think I have, I do actually do some boulder triples.
[7009.22s -> 7011.38s]  So I do like, cause my boulder is quite short.
[7012.66s -> 7018.18s]  I do try and do some like, I have more recently done a few sessions where I do like the
[7018.82s -> 7020.74s]  boulder triples just to like power out.
[7021.86s -> 7025.30s]  And I haven't done it very much and I haven't done it very much in the past.
[7025.30s -> 7027.46s]  So it will be interesting to see if it does make a difference.
[7028.82s -> 7035.30s]  But generally, not only just in the specifics of working on one thing, but generally that
[7035.30s -> 7041.78s]  like kind of like power focus has like applied to how I've approached climbing in a whole.
[7041.86s -> 7048.18s]  Like usually I would like focus on my training until the point where like some of the things
[7048.18s -> 7051.22s]  that I would try, I would do relatively quickly.
[7051.94s -> 7056.90s]  So I'm quite new to the project and game in general, to be honest, like it's only really
[7056.90s -> 7064.58s]  in like the past year that I've spent like more than like three or four sessions in a
[7064.58s -> 7065.46s]  year on something.
[7065.62s -> 7072.98s]  Um, like I've had climbs, which I've like tried left, gone back to over like a series
[7072.98s -> 7077.78s]  of years, but, uh, it's only recently in like the last year or so that I've like, just
[7077.78s -> 7080.58s]  tried something like solely.
[7080.58s -> 7084.66s]  So like, I'd like try it, try it, that kind of thing.
[7084.66s -> 7090.58s]  Um, so I'm quite new to the game, so I'm not the most credible source, but I definitely
[7090.58s -> 7091.86s]  think either probably work.
[7092.82s -> 7097.78s]  There's definitely best people to ask about the intricacies of like the sports science
[7097.78s -> 7098.58s]  behind it.
[7098.58s -> 7103.94s]  I mean, it's obviously going to be very useful to be able to operate for more moves in a
[7103.94s -> 7104.34s]  row.
[7104.34s -> 7109.86s]  If like your, if your project's quite long, but I also think like you can get quite a
[7109.86s -> 7113.86s]  lot better at these things relatively quickly when you're new to them.
[7113.86s -> 7119.22s]  So like if you're like me and you haven't really done much, like I felt like power,
[7119.30s -> 7123.70s]  endurance, the training, a few sessions, like once a week or something will probably
[7123.70s -> 7125.94s]  make quite a big difference in the first instance.
[7125.94s -> 7126.50s]  Yeah.
[7126.50s -> 7130.18s]  But if you've done absolutely loads, like you'll probably get diminishing returns from
[7130.18s -> 7130.34s]  it.
[7130.34s -> 7137.46s]  And so it's probably not quite as important, but, um, yeah, I'll be able to report back
[7137.46s -> 7139.86s]  post Switzerland trip to see if that's made any difference.
[7140.74s -> 7141.14s]  Awesome.
[7142.10s -> 7143.70s]  Excited to hear about that.
[7143.70s -> 7144.34s]  All right, man.
[7144.34s -> 7145.94s]  I feel like I need to check in with you again.
[7146.02s -> 7150.02s]  I've been, uh, I really appreciate your time, but I want to respect your time as well.
[7150.02s -> 7155.78s]  We've been going for about two hours now and I have lots of things left on my list.
[7155.78s -> 7156.50s]  How are you feeling?
[7157.38s -> 7158.34s]  No, I'm doing okay.
[7158.34s -> 7158.74s]  Yeah, yeah.
[7158.74s -> 7158.98s]  Okay.
[7158.98s -> 7160.66s]  I'm, I can, I can keep going.
[7160.66s -> 7160.90s]  Okay.
[7161.62s -> 7165.78s]  And again, like we've got tons of listener questions, a bunch more things we can talk
[7165.78s -> 7168.74s]  about in a round two, if you're up for that as well.
[7169.78s -> 7170.74s]  But yeah, how about this?
[7170.74s -> 7173.30s]  Let me, um, let me share a few thoughts.
[7173.30s -> 7178.10s]  There's a few big topics that I'd really love to spend some time on, and then we can
[7178.10s -> 7182.74s]  just decide, let me know, um, which of these feel most interesting to you to talk about.
[7182.74s -> 7186.74s]  We can go through all of them if, if you feel up for it, or we can just focus in on
[7186.74s -> 7187.46s]  one or two of them.
[7188.10s -> 7191.22s]  But yeah, things I still wanted to talk to you about in this conversation.
[7192.82s -> 7193.70s]  Burden of dreams.
[7193.70s -> 7195.78s]  That's something we haven't really talked about much at all.
[7195.78s -> 7198.90s]  I loved our conversation last week about it.
[7198.90s -> 7200.02s]  I thought that was super interesting.
[7200.02s -> 7201.70s]  So that's something we could spend some time on.
[7202.58s -> 7207.62s]  Goals and goal setting and hearing about your dad, I think would be really interesting
[7207.62s -> 7209.06s]  how you think about that.
[7209.06s -> 7213.14s]  And then I also want to make sure that we have time for some of your thoughts around
[7213.14s -> 7214.10s]  environmentalism.
[7214.10s -> 7219.62s]  I know that's really important to you and you think a lot about travel considerations.
[7220.26s -> 7223.54s]  I think that's really interesting as a pro climber, someone who wants to travel the
[7223.54s -> 7226.34s]  world and test yourself on some of the hardest things out there.
[7227.30s -> 7232.74s]  I'd love to hear how you balance that with having a low carbon footprint and being a
[7232.74s -> 7236.82s]  good steward, because you very clearly put a lot of thought into that and have some really
[7236.82s -> 7237.86s]  interesting thoughts there.
[7237.86s -> 7239.62s]  So yeah, what do you think?
[7241.06s -> 7241.62s]  Do you want to?
[7241.62s -> 7244.50s]  Yeah, I'm happy to give them a go.
[7244.50s -> 7246.02s]  It feels like attainable.
[7247.30s -> 7249.30s]  If you're happy to, yeah.
[7249.30s -> 7249.86s]  I'd love it.
[7251.30s -> 7252.18s]  I can do this all day.
[7252.18s -> 7255.30s]  I'm having fun.
[7256.18s -> 7256.66s]  We'll try.
[7257.30s -> 7259.70s]  Yeah, we'll try to cover all of those.
[7259.70s -> 7260.50s]  Okay.
[7260.50s -> 7260.82s]  Yeah.
[7261.86s -> 7267.54s]  Do you want to stick on the climbing specific and go burn of dreams or more like general
[7267.54s -> 7269.54s]  approach and go goal setting first?
[7269.54s -> 7273.94s]  Let's go burn of dreams next, because I got a lot of questions for you about that.
[7273.94s -> 7278.34s]  And a lot of people, I think, have seen your wedge video that came out recently, you training
[7278.34s -> 7280.50s]  on your board and you climbing on the replica.
[7281.14s -> 7284.26s]  And you just talked about using that app on your phone to scan the holds.
[7284.26s -> 7288.18s]  And you actually had someone make replica holds for you to train on.
[7288.18s -> 7290.26s]  So I think that'd be really interesting to hear about.
[7290.82s -> 7296.10s]  And I was curious about it in the context of this, again, like what we talked about
[7296.10s -> 7299.46s]  at the start of the conversation, how you think about being a specialist.
[7300.26s -> 7303.78s]  You and I had a conversation about mastery as a concept.
[7303.78s -> 7305.30s]  I thought that was super interesting.
[7305.30s -> 7310.66s]  And you kind of made this distinction between doing things that are difficult for you, which
[7312.02s -> 7313.22s]  it could be any number of things.
[7313.22s -> 7319.06s]  It could be a slopey font climb that's not V16 because you don't train in that style
[7319.06s -> 7324.90s]  as often versus mastery where you sound like you're a lot more interested in just trying
[7324.90s -> 7329.06s]  to become a master at this thing that you're very good at and that you enjoy in climbing,
[7329.06s -> 7330.90s]  which is the style that you've been talking about.
[7331.70s -> 7332.26s]  Yeah.
[7332.26s -> 7337.06s]  So anyway, that conversation and then how you think about specializing and doubling
[7337.06s -> 7339.46s]  down on your strengths versus working on your weaknesses.
[7340.02s -> 7343.78s]  I thought the story you told me about what you learned when you went and
[7343.78s -> 7347.54s]  tried Burden of Dreams was super interesting because it kind of connects those pieces.
[7349.06s -> 7349.70s]  Yeah.
[7349.70s -> 7355.46s]  Do you want to just start by telling me how this first became a goal for you or
[7356.26s -> 7359.14s]  your first trip to go check it out and what came out of that?
[7360.18s -> 7361.38s]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[7361.46s -> 7361.70s]  Yeah.
[7361.70s -> 7364.34s]  So yeah, Burden of Dreams.
[7364.34s -> 7374.98s]  I think I was initially quite motivated to try it because I'd had a spell of climbing
[7374.98s -> 7385.86s]  just around the UK and I'd done a lot of the projects which I had around my home and I'd
[7385.86s -> 7390.58s]  gone and traveled to some stuff around the UK, which I'd done relatively quickly.
[7391.06s -> 7397.06s]  I mean, I know there's really hard climbing in the UK, which I haven't done and stuff to
[7397.06s -> 7399.86s]  be found, which will really push me.
[7399.86s -> 7407.78s]  But it'd been a couple of years since I'd traveled abroad and climbed and I'd almost
[7407.78s -> 7409.06s]  felt like I'd lost my bearing.
[7409.06s -> 7412.42s]  Most of the hard climbing I was doing around that time was stuff that I was developing.
[7412.66s -> 7422.42s]  And so I was a bit uncertain about where I was in relation to the sport in general.
[7422.42s -> 7423.70s]  And Burden of Dreams was like...
[7424.26s -> 7425.22s]  I was also looking...
[7426.34s -> 7428.02s]  Okay, yeah, two points.
[7428.02s -> 7437.94s]  Burden of Dreams in many ways was new ground for bouldering and it captured quite a lot
[7437.94s -> 7442.10s]  of mystique about a new level in climbing.
[7442.10s -> 7447.86s]  And I think it kind of did it in such a pure style of there was no tricks.
[7448.90s -> 7458.66s]  There's no avoiding a single set of slick, small edges on a 45 degree granite face.
[7458.66s -> 7460.82s]  And so that was a proper allure to me.
[7462.66s -> 7463.94s]  What was the other point I was making?
[7464.74s -> 7468.82s]  I don't mean to derail you, but do you mind if I jump in and add more context for people
[7468.82s -> 7469.62s]  listening?
[7469.62s -> 7470.42s]  Because I do this.
[7471.06s -> 7472.26s]  Yeah, I make this mistake a lot.
[7472.26s -> 7476.42s]  I just talk about these things, just assuming that everyone knows what they are, which maybe
[7476.42s -> 7477.30s]  they do, maybe they don't.
[7477.30s -> 7483.22s]  But for people listening, Burden of Dreams was the first proposed V17 in the world.
[7483.22s -> 7487.46s]  First ascent by Nale Hukataival several years ago now.
[7487.46s -> 7492.90s]  And it was featured in a film called The Lapnor Project, which is like a 30 minute film.
[7492.98s -> 7493.54s]  Really well done.
[7494.18s -> 7498.02s]  And it was Nale's home project in Finland.
[7498.02s -> 7504.74s]  And he put like six seasons into it or something, like 80 plus days and sent the thing.
[7504.74s -> 7507.62s]  And it just looks like an outdoor board climb.
[7507.62s -> 7513.78s]  It's just like a five or six move, just pure sort of boulder problem on this overhanging
[7513.78s -> 7514.10s]  face.
[7514.10s -> 7516.42s]  And it just looks insanely hard.
[7518.42s -> 7519.06s]  Anyway.
[7519.06s -> 7526.02s]  And it's got a rare simplicity to it as well, which is, yes, strangely quite alluring.
[7527.06s -> 7535.22s]  But alongside that and the significance of this boulder within climbing, I think at
[7535.22s -> 7542.74s]  the time as well, I also just made the full decision to step away from competitions.
[7542.74s -> 7547.46s]  And I think a big part of that is goal setting has always been really important to me.
[7547.46s -> 7553.94s]  And it's kind of like the act of setting a goal within competitions is relatively easy
[7553.94s -> 7557.30s]  in that it's so measurable.
[7557.30s -> 7561.78s]  You have a specific date of this competition and you have a number at the end of that
[7561.78s -> 7563.78s]  day and you want it to be as low as possible.
[7563.78s -> 7565.06s]  And that's your rank.
[7565.06s -> 7572.50s]  And you can create a cutoff point where this is ambitious, but this is what I'm going for.
[7572.90s -> 7579.14s]  Whereas outdoors, I'd found for a little while, I was like, oh, I'm really motivated
[7579.14s -> 7579.86s]  to try this.
[7579.86s -> 7580.82s]  This looks great.
[7580.82s -> 7582.18s]  I'll try all these things.
[7582.18s -> 7583.54s]  I want to do this project.
[7583.54s -> 7588.90s]  But I was lacking the structure of that ambitious goal.
[7588.90s -> 7591.86s]  I've always liked having goals, which are very ambitious.
[7591.86s -> 7594.90s]  I've always found that's really driven me.
[7595.14s -> 7603.86s]  And so in search of an ambitious goal, this was the very obvious choice.
[7606.74s -> 7612.02s]  It was kind of at the time, definitely the hardest boulder in the world.
[7613.46s -> 7620.42s]  And I was so intrigued by it that I kind of set that as my goal.
[7620.98s -> 7625.70s]  And I think part of me, because all I had to go off really was that video.
[7626.66s -> 7632.50s]  I didn't know anyone who tried it and I've never met Nale.
[7634.26s -> 7637.38s]  So I kind of only had that video to go off.
[7637.38s -> 7644.02s]  And I think part of me at the time, it looks like it is small holds on a board, which usually
[7644.02s -> 7644.90s]  suits me quite well.
[7646.26s -> 7648.74s]  And I mean, they are small holds and it is basically a board.
[7649.70s -> 7658.42s]  I think on a discussion of styles, it suited me a lot less well than I think I expected
[7658.42s -> 7659.14s]  it would.
[7659.14s -> 7663.94s]  So essentially the mechanics behind that is the rock is really slick.
[7664.50s -> 7666.74s]  The holes aren't that in cut.
[7666.74s -> 7674.10s]  And so basically what that means is because the holds are kind of flat or slopey and it's
[7674.10s -> 7679.22s]  slippy rock, you can't really rely on generating any force outwards from the rock.
[7679.22s -> 7682.50s]  You rely on compression between these slick edges.
[7683.14s -> 7689.94s]  And so to do the moves, the first move and the last move are the obvious hard moves.
[7689.94s -> 7691.78s]  You've got to move so quickly.
[7691.78s -> 7697.30s]  You've got to be able to generate force really powerfully to get into a position which isn't,
[7697.30s -> 7703.22s]  once you're in the positions, they're not that hard, but you're relatively stable in
[7703.22s -> 7707.78s]  that position and you're relatively unstable in the position you generate from.
[7707.78s -> 7710.34s]  You've just got to move lightning quick between them.
[7710.34s -> 7711.54s]  And now he's really good at that.
[7711.54s -> 7715.14s]  Now that I've gone and tried that boulder and looked at that video back, like I can
[7715.14s -> 7718.90s]  see how like dynamically moves between those positions.
[7718.90s -> 7721.22s]  Like he's amazing at that kind of style of climbing.
[7722.18s -> 7727.22s]  And I've always relied on going quite slow, kind of creating control and stability in
[7727.22s -> 7728.26s]  those positions.
[7728.26s -> 7729.62s]  And the feet are just too bad.
[7729.62s -> 7732.50s]  And the holds are too slopey and slick to be able to do that.
[7732.50s -> 7737.70s]  So you do have to just like move so quickly and like kind of snap between these positions.
[7739.46s -> 7746.82s]  And so that was something that was hard enough that really kind of emphasized that gap in
[7746.82s -> 7747.46s]  my climbing.
[7747.46s -> 7752.42s]  And like, it's funny to watch me, like I watch clips of me trying it and I'm like, wow, I'm
[7752.42s -> 7754.02s]  like so sluggish on that move.
[7755.06s -> 7759.14s]  Kind of like, I'm kind of like, cause I know I can hold the positions quite comfortably.
[7759.14s -> 7760.82s]  I'm like, oh, can't you just do it?
[7761.14s -> 7764.02s]  I just willing my arm to move quicker.
[7765.54s -> 7772.10s]  But anyway, yeah, it's kind of like, in many ways it was like, obviously I wanted to be
[7772.10s -> 7776.98s]  able to do well on it or like maybe better than I did, but it was quite exciting.
[7776.98s -> 7783.62s]  Like it feels possible for me in that like the positions feel comfortable and like the
[7783.62s -> 7785.78s]  middle section I was quite reliable on.
[7786.34s -> 7793.30s]  Um, but like, it just feels like, it feels like I have to do that climb.
[7793.30s -> 7798.58s]  It feels like I have to be a better climber and I've spoken loads about like, understand
[7798.58s -> 7802.26s]  what style you enjoy and like, kind of like what you're good at.
[7802.26s -> 7806.34s]  And like, I know that that's not what I'm good at, but like, it's kind of like something
[7806.34s -> 7808.66s]  which is really ambitious, really challenges me.
[7808.66s -> 7813.06s]  And like I have to adapt, which kind of like a different challenge in itself.
[7813.06s -> 7820.50s]  Like one day I'd love to find a climb that suits me really well, or like almost perfectly
[7820.50s -> 7824.26s]  and find a bit of rock, which like suits that style.
[7824.26s -> 7828.74s]  And like, it takes me a really long time to be able to do it in my perfect style.
[7828.74s -> 7832.82s]  And I think that's, that's like, you just had, we had that discussion of difficulty
[7832.82s -> 7833.38s]  and mastery.
[7833.38s -> 7841.38s]  Like, so I spoke to, I recently did a podcast with Hazel Finley and we discussed a lot about
[7841.38s -> 7841.62s]  this.
[7841.62s -> 7846.50s]  She actually pitched me the question of mastery and that's really got, what got me thinking
[7846.50s -> 7847.06s]  about it.
[7847.06s -> 7853.38s]  And I kind of feel like in many ways, because it's kind of so subjective, the idea of mastery
[7853.38s -> 7858.58s]  within climbing, my kind of perspective on it was, I felt like it was like something
[7858.58s -> 7864.98s]  which like, is like kind of quite a collaborative thing in that like, cause no one person, like
[7864.98s -> 7868.74s]  some people might say mastery is to be able to walk up to any bit of rock and be able
[7868.74s -> 7869.38s]  to climb it.
[7869.38s -> 7872.82s]  Like whether you're in Font or whether you're in Switzerland or if you're in the Lake
[7872.82s -> 7877.86s]  District or if you're in Wyoming, like you can just, or Yosemite, you can just climb
[7877.86s -> 7878.98s]  any bit of rock.
[7878.98s -> 7886.58s]  Some people might be like to be as close to the physical, like limits of human capabilities
[7886.58s -> 7887.54s]  in a certain style.
[7887.54s -> 7891.94s]  You might look at like Burden of Dreams, but I don't think, I don't think we have like
[7891.94s -> 7897.30s]  really have had anything that close to the limits of human potential in climbing yet.
[7897.30s -> 7902.58s]  But it might just be like something which is like something which somebody really excels
[7902.58s -> 7902.82s]  in.
[7902.82s -> 7908.02s]  Like, it's like, it's like a little contribution towards mastery, but like, because it's like
[7908.02s -> 7913.46s]  such a subjective definition, it feels like it's a work of like a collective, this concept
[7913.46s -> 7914.50s]  of mastery.
[7914.50s -> 7921.86s]  And so I feel like for me, like that's a way which we can contribute to that, like to find
[7922.66s -> 7927.46s]  the things that we're good at, like to find the bits of rock, which kind of like allows
[7927.46s -> 7932.34s]  us to kind of just not display it.
[7932.34s -> 7938.42s]  And that sounds quite performancey, but like it, like the, those bits of rock then stand
[7938.42s -> 7946.26s]  as like a bit of like a, like a measure of like the kind of level in that style, which
[7946.26s -> 7951.22s]  like, I don't know, I've been like really inspired by that in my climbing, like seeing
[7951.22s -> 7951.94s]  all the things.
[7951.94s -> 7957.06s]  But lots of like, it's cool actually, like lots of like the Mellow crew, which I got
[7957.06s -> 7961.70s]  to meet this, well, I'd met Daniel before, but like I hadn't met Dave before.
[7961.70s -> 7962.18s]  It's cool.
[7962.18s -> 7964.90s]  Like when I was growing up, I was like so inspired by those guys.
[7966.26s -> 7972.98s]  And it's quite, they're all like, Dave, Daniel, and Sean, all like obvious like age gaps.
[7972.98s -> 7977.22s]  And like, I mean, they're actually all been at the top of the game for like years, but
[7977.22s -> 7981.78s]  it's quite cool to see how like they all climb together anyway.
[7981.78s -> 7985.78s]  But like, anyway, I felt like for me, they've always like contributed quite a lot to like
[7985.78s -> 7990.10s]  mastery in certain places in the world or certain aspects of bouldering.
[7990.66s -> 7992.82s]  I dunno, I found that really inspiring myself.
[7992.82s -> 7999.46s]  So I feel like, yeah, I'd love to be able to find a bit of rock one day, which like
[8000.34s -> 8002.50s]  is really ambitious and suits me perfectly.
[8002.50s -> 8008.50s]  And it feels like I could maybe make some contributions to that concept, but it's kind
[8008.50s -> 8011.22s]  of like a completely different like challenge.
[8011.22s -> 8018.02s]  And I love, I really enjoy being challenged and being challenged in like a climbing context
[8018.02s -> 8021.38s]  because I kind of like love the feeling of climbing anyway.
[8022.42s -> 8028.18s]  This is kind of like a very new, like different kind of avenue of climbing in China, like
[8028.58s -> 8033.94s]  fit into or trying to relate to something that somebody else has been really good at.
[8033.94s -> 8039.30s]  So like now they with burden of dreams, it's like, I've found, like, I've got to like,
[8039.30s -> 8044.26s]  try and relate to that feeling myself.
[8044.26s -> 8048.02s]  And I don't know, I feel like I have a long way to go, but it's quite exciting.
[8048.02s -> 8051.06s]  It's quite like a novel way of moving for me.
[8051.06s -> 8055.70s]  And I'm quite looking forward to like training in that style a bit more.
[8055.78s -> 8062.58s]  Frustratingly with my people that might have seen that replica training video that I did
[8062.58s -> 8068.34s]  with my friend, Sam, who's the guy who runs Wedge, but I haven't really been able to actually
[8068.34s -> 8069.38s]  train on it that much.
[8070.26s -> 8077.46s]  So I set it up in the middle of summer, which is, so it's way too warm and it's pretty
[8077.46s -> 8079.06s]  skin intensive to climb.
[8079.06s -> 8081.54s]  And those are pretty slick holds.
[8082.10s -> 8085.06s]  I think that replica might be a little bit harder, even than the real thing.
[8085.06s -> 8088.98s]  But, um, uh, could just the texture of them.
[8088.98s -> 8096.50s]  Um, and I will say I slight, I think I like, uh, slightly on the steeper side.
[8096.50s -> 8104.58s]  Um, and so, well, he's kind of thought it's 45, but it's kind of like 45.6, isn't it?
[8104.58s -> 8107.94s]  I just wanted to make sure I wasn't making an easier version.
[8108.90s -> 8112.90s]  I just wanted to make sure I wasn't making an easier version, but yeah, I overcooked,
[8112.90s -> 8113.62s]  I overcooked it.
[8113.62s -> 8120.74s]  But, um, I haven't really been able to train on it that much.
[8120.74s -> 8123.86s]  Anyway, I picked up a finger injury as well, which kind of stopped me.
[8123.86s -> 8127.62s]  But this winter, my hope is to be able to do a bunch more on it.
[8127.62s -> 8131.06s]  And, uh, I didn't really feel a rush, which is quite nice.
[8131.06s -> 8131.94s]  Nice.
[8131.94s -> 8133.62s]  Like I'm aware I'm quite young.
[8133.62s -> 8136.90s]  I've got a lot of time and I'm aware that boulder's not going anywhere.
[8137.54s -> 8140.58s]  So I don't feel the time pressure so much.
[8141.14s -> 8142.74s]  I think like, it's kind of a weird thing.
[8142.74s -> 8145.06s]  Like I feel fortunate in that.
[8145.06s -> 8152.50s]  I'm usually always like motivated enough within climbing to, I have like this drive for like
[8152.50s -> 8153.38s]  self-development.
[8154.02s -> 8158.34s]  I haven't quite understood it yet, but I've always been motivated to want to train and
[8158.34s -> 8160.42s]  be better myself.
[8160.50s -> 8168.66s]  And so like, I'm not too concerned that by not having like a time on like, uh, not like
[8168.66s -> 8174.10s]  putting a date on when I want to do stuff that I'm not like falling behind or slacking
[8174.10s -> 8175.54s]  or taking my eye off the ball.
[8175.54s -> 8182.50s]  Um, I usually find it having specific goals gives me some form of direction, but I would
[8182.50s -> 8185.22s]  probably be doing a lot of training and trying to be better.
[8185.22s -> 8189.62s]  Even if I didn't have specific things that I was trying to do, it would probably just
[8189.62s -> 8192.98s]  feel, it would feel a bit more meaningless.
[8193.62s -> 8200.34s]  Even if the meaning I derive is from climbing up a bit of rock, but we won't get so philosophical.
[8202.34s -> 8203.30s]  Well, that's cool though.
[8203.30s -> 8207.70s]  I mean, like that was kind of the, you know, I think I had heard from Tom Herbert initially
[8207.70s -> 8209.94s]  that you were planning, planning to go try that thing.
[8209.94s -> 8214.18s]  And of course that was so exciting because, you know, there's maybe three or four proposed
[8214.18s -> 8217.06s]  V-17s now in the world, but none of them have been repeated yet.
[8217.06s -> 8220.66s]  So the thought of you going and trying and potentially repeating Burden of Dreams is
[8220.66s -> 8222.18s]  just, that's big news.
[8222.18s -> 8223.46s]  That's really cool and climbing.
[8223.46s -> 8228.90s]  And so, yeah, super interesting to hear that it, um, because it's a board style on crimps,
[8228.90s -> 8231.22s]  you expected it to fit you really well.
[8231.22s -> 8235.54s]  It doesn't fit you quite as well as you hoped, but it sounds like it's still very much a
[8235.54s -> 8236.26s]  priority for you.
[8236.26s -> 8237.54s]  It's like at the top of the list.
[8238.50s -> 8244.50s]  Yeah, no, in terms of like more time, like, yeah, I'm pretty happy to be transparent about
[8244.50s -> 8246.34s]  my, like, I'm really keen.
[8246.34s -> 8251.38s]  I'm going out to Switzerland next week, um, uh, and I'm really looking forward to that.
[8251.38s -> 8257.14s]  But, uh, my hope is once I'm back, um, which will be like mid November or something, my
[8257.14s -> 8264.58s]  plan is kind of to try and train effectively on that replica over the winter, um, to get
[8264.58s -> 8269.38s]  to a point where I feel like I'd have, but I probably would because I've got the replica,
[8269.38s -> 8269.94s]  it's kind of good.
[8269.94s -> 8271.62s]  It's a long way for me to travel.
[8271.62s -> 8279.14s]  Um, and so in order to like, can I respect that I can like, kind of the replicas helpful
[8279.14s -> 8285.78s]  in that it will mean that I probably will only do that journey when I'm relatively confident
[8285.78s -> 8288.82s]  that I have like all the tools to do that boulder.
[8289.54s -> 8293.14s]  So I think like it's going to be really useful in that sense.
[8293.14s -> 8298.50s]  But my hope is to be able to train over the winter and should things go well, it's hard
[8298.50s -> 8304.26s]  to like predict my progression on it, but should things go well to then in spring go
[8304.26s -> 8308.02s]  out back out to Finland and, uh, go and try that thing.
[8308.02s -> 8308.58s]  Nice.
[8309.38s -> 8309.62s]  Yeah.
[8309.62s -> 8310.02s]  We'll see.
[8310.98s -> 8313.30s]  What does that, what does that mean to you?
[8313.30s -> 8318.66s]  Um, do you feel like you have to send the replica before going or is it just more go
[8318.66s -> 8322.74s]  by feel, like just having a sensation of feeling confident on each of the sections of it?
[8322.74s -> 8327.30s]  Like what is it going to take for you to feel like, okay, I'm ready to go back to Finland
[8327.30s -> 8328.02s]  to try this thing?
[8328.90s -> 8332.74s]  Uh, to be honest, just doing the moves on that one would probably be enough.
[8332.74s -> 8333.86s]  Like, okay.
[8333.86s -> 8336.82s]  It really does feel like it does feel hard.
[8336.82s -> 8339.70s]  Um, I think, I think it does feel a bit harder.
[8340.26s -> 8343.94s]  So if I could do the moves on it, that would probably be a pretty good indication.
[8345.22s -> 8349.06s]  Maybe the reliability of the last move as well would be quite important to me.
[8349.06s -> 8353.22s]  The first move, it's kind of okay if that's not reliable because it's the first move.
[8353.22s -> 8361.22s]  But, um, uh, if you drop in the last move nine times out of 10, it's, uh, not encouraging
[8361.22s -> 8361.78s]  from the start.
[8362.58s -> 8362.82s]  Right.
[8364.74s -> 8365.06s]  Right.
[8365.06s -> 8365.38s]  Yeah.
[8365.38s -> 8371.38s]  So yeah, in terms of time, yeah, probably would be, yeah, having the last move reliable
[8371.38s -> 8376.42s]  and maybe being able to do it for more moving would be a good measure for me that I'd have
[8376.42s -> 8377.30s]  a decent shot.
[8378.66s -> 8379.78s]  I have a note in front of me.
[8379.78s -> 8382.90s]  You mentioned that you have a finger injury, so you haven't been able to train on it too
[8382.90s -> 8383.14s]  much.
[8383.94s -> 8387.62s]  I just have a note in front of me that says stabbing his hand with screwdriver with a
[8387.62s -> 8388.58s]  bunch of question marks.
[8388.58s -> 8393.22s]  And I, I don't really remember somehow I've managed to forget what we talked about there,
[8393.22s -> 8395.46s]  but does that make any sense to you?
[8396.50s -> 8398.98s]  Yeah, that was, that was actually an unfortunate.
[8399.70s -> 8399.94s]  Yeah.
[8399.94s -> 8404.02s]  To be fair, actually, I didn't actually go out to Finland in that good of form.
[8404.02s -> 8408.02s]  It'd be good to, it would have been nice to try it when I was feeling like I was firing
[8408.02s -> 8411.14s]  on all cylinders, but yeah, I hadn't been doing.
[8411.94s -> 8416.42s]  I wasn't actually in particularly good form kind of the whole of 2021.
[8416.42s -> 8417.22s]  Really.
[8417.22s -> 8419.86s]  I wasn't like going super well.
[8420.66s -> 8424.98s]  I wasn't in the greatest place, like just like in my life anyway.
[8424.98s -> 8429.78s]  And so I was like a little bit like questioning a lot of things.
[8429.78s -> 8434.34s]  And I don't know if that is some part like filtered into my climbing.
[8434.34s -> 8436.50s]  Anyway, I wasn't properly in it.
[8436.50s -> 8439.86s]  I wasn't properly loving it to the same degree that I have over the past.
[8440.66s -> 8441.46s]  This past year.
[8443.54s -> 8448.34s]  But then, yeah, like I think it was less than two weeks before I went out to Finland.
[8448.34s -> 8450.34s]  Will it be like 10 days or something?
[8450.34s -> 8453.86s]  I think I had like two sessions after it before I drove out.
[8454.50s -> 8457.54s]  I was doing some work on my van and it was wet.
[8458.18s -> 8461.70s]  Classically in autumn in, in the lakes.
[8461.70s -> 8466.90s]  And I was kind of rushing a bit and I just had a flathead screwdriver, which I was basically
[8466.90s -> 8467.46s]  what I ended up.
[8467.46s -> 8471.86s]  I ended up like spearing it into my hand and then I was actually quite lucky.
[8471.86s -> 8477.94s]  I like missed my index flexor went in between my index flexor and like the main meat of
[8477.94s -> 8479.78s]  my like thumb muscle.
[8481.46s -> 8482.42s]  I was quite fortunate.
[8484.26s -> 8487.30s]  So I could like, I could still like use my index.
[8487.30s -> 8491.22s]  I just couldn't like the movement of touching my pinky to my thumb.
[8491.22s -> 8491.94s]  I couldn't really do.
[8492.58s -> 8498.34s]  So that made me because, because of that, I had some stitches in there.
[8499.22s -> 8504.18s]  I couldn't like, I couldn't snatch holds as much, even with my left hand.
[8504.18s -> 8507.30s]  So I had to be like a little bit more, more control even.
[8507.30s -> 8509.30s]  So that was really suboptimal prep.
[8509.30s -> 8509.54s]  Yeah.
[8511.78s -> 8514.82s]  So right now I'm being very careful with the flathead screwdriver.
[8514.82s -> 8523.46s]  Yeah, no, that was a, yeah, just another layer of complication.
[8523.46s -> 8527.38s]  I'd almost forgotten about it actually, but it's quite a funny little detail in the story.
[8527.38s -> 8527.62s]  Yeah.
[8529.22s -> 8529.62s]  Yeah.
[8529.62s -> 8530.02s]  I'm glad.
[8530.02s -> 8531.70s]  It sounds like it could have easily been a lot worse.
[8531.70s -> 8534.50s]  So I'm glad that you, you've been able to make a recovery from that.
[8535.30s -> 8536.26s]  Yeah, no, I did all right.
[8536.26s -> 8539.22s]  It was relatively short term, a flesh wound.
[8539.38s -> 8539.54s]  Yeah.
[8541.30s -> 8544.02s]  And then I want to ask briefly before we move on,
[8544.02s -> 8546.98s]  just if you could share your thoughts on replicas.
[8546.98s -> 8548.42s]  I heard you say something interesting.
[8548.42s -> 8553.22s]  I think it was in that wedge video when you were showing the viewers the,
[8553.22s -> 8555.54s]  the replica of Burden and I'll link to that video.
[8555.54s -> 8557.54s]  You guys should definitely watch it if you're interested in this.
[8558.66s -> 8561.06s]  Super cool to see the shapes of the holds and things.
[8561.06s -> 8564.66s]  But yeah, you mentioned kind of like a light bulb moment that you had
[8565.38s -> 8567.86s]  training on your board and noticing how easy,
[8567.86s -> 8571.06s]  how much easier climbs got when you just were climbing on them all the time.
[8571.06s -> 8575.94s]  And that kind of led you to this shift in philosophy and really focusing on replicas.
[8575.94s -> 8577.46s]  But can you talk me through that a little bit?
[8578.82s -> 8579.70s]  Yeah, I think.
[8581.86s -> 8585.38s]  Yeah, I definitely, it's quite a fun like jigsaw puzzle as well.
[8585.38s -> 8588.66s]  Just the act of setting a replica and having it like, I don't know,
[8588.74s -> 8593.78s]  there's something quite fun about like trying to capture a bit of that,
[8593.78s -> 8600.50s]  like kind of the climbs on the rocks and like trying to like bring a little bit of them home
[8600.50s -> 8603.22s]  and kind of like have that familiarity.
[8603.22s -> 8607.06s]  I think like in terms of like the difference I've really noticed,
[8607.06s -> 8610.66s]  I set a replica of a climb,
[8611.62s -> 8615.62s]  a project I'd been trying in North Wales called Hours of Wonder.
[8615.62s -> 8618.02s]  And it was kind of the sit start to this project.
[8618.10s -> 8619.94s]  And it's like incredibly shouldery.
[8620.66s -> 8624.74s]  It's the one I managed to do it this summer.
[8625.46s -> 8626.02s]  V16.
[8626.02s -> 8629.30s]  And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, V16.
[8630.02s -> 8634.82s]  Yeah, I think I thought at the time maybe it was the hardest thing I've done to date,
[8634.82s -> 8637.30s]  but it's also one of the best.
[8637.30s -> 8642.42s]  So that's something I was definitely pretty chuffed with that one.
[8642.98s -> 8650.42s]  But I found training on this replica for that was really helpful in that
[8650.42s -> 8655.14s]  it's like brutally like isolates your shoulder, your right shoulder.
[8655.14s -> 8658.02s]  It's like the crux sequence at the bottom section.
[8658.74s -> 8661.06s]  And I hadn't done the move when I tried it year before.
[8662.58s -> 8667.30s]  And what I was finding is I'd have like four goes on the move
[8667.30s -> 8670.10s]  and then I'd feel like my shoulder was like cooked.
[8671.06s -> 8675.06s]  I had a few sessions a year before and I'd have like four or five goes
[8675.06s -> 8677.70s]  and I'd be like, right, that's my session over.
[8677.70s -> 8679.06s]  And it's like a 40 minute walk.
[8679.06s -> 8681.30s]  So up a steep, steep hill.
[8681.30s -> 8685.94s]  So it's kind of like you want to make your attempts count
[8685.94s -> 8688.10s]  and I'd like have a session on it.
[8688.10s -> 8692.34s]  And then I'd have like three days of intense doms in my shoulder.
[8692.34s -> 8694.90s]  And I couldn't function properly.
[8695.46s -> 8699.70s]  And so anyway, I set this replica which isolates your shoulder in a similar
[8701.06s -> 8704.66s]  manner and I actually didn't even have that many sessions on it.
[8704.66s -> 8710.98s]  I had maybe like four sessions where I'd try it like not loads of times,
[8710.98s -> 8713.46s]  but like a few times in that session,
[8713.46s -> 8718.42s]  enough to like kind of induce a few of those like that muscle soreness.
[8718.42s -> 8722.42s]  But it took like over a period of like two or three weeks.
[8723.38s -> 8728.34s]  I just had like, yeah, maybe like a handful of like half sessions on it.
[8728.98s -> 8731.38s]  And by the time I got to that climb,
[8731.38s -> 8735.06s]  like everything was recruited enough in the position that I could have like,
[8735.06s -> 8738.66s]  I didn't even get like doms at all the following days.
[8738.66s -> 8743.38s]  Like I was just like, it didn't take me very long to recruit into like the
[8743.38s -> 8747.94s]  brutality of that like specific position, which is like very like niche.
[8747.94s -> 8749.30s]  And like, I just had kind of,
[8750.10s -> 8753.30s]  it really opened up my eyes to like how valuable it can be
[8753.70s -> 8762.18s]  in terms of like preparing you for something where you don't necessarily want like,
[8762.18s -> 8765.54s]  just like your muscle to be like the limiting factor you want.
[8765.54s -> 8769.46s]  Like it's kind of like another thing you can control.
[8769.46s -> 8774.74s]  So like being recruited into those, especially such like alien positions,
[8774.74s -> 8776.50s]  which felt really helpful.
[8777.22s -> 8782.50s]  And I also felt like I'd had so over the years, I'd created so many
[8783.30s -> 8784.66s]  I don't change my board that often.
[8784.66s -> 8788.82s]  Like I'll tweak a little bit, but there's problems I've got on that board,
[8788.82s -> 8792.02s]  which were like projects or like things that used to be projects.
[8792.02s -> 8794.66s]  And they've been on there for like six years or something.
[8796.02s -> 8797.78s]  And I've still like kind of kept those.
[8797.78s -> 8802.42s]  And I was kind of like, oh, these are problems, which I know so well now.
[8802.42s -> 8804.26s]  And they're probably really hard.
[8804.26s -> 8806.98s]  And like, I've learned them and they're so natural for me.
[8807.54s -> 8809.78s]  And I've put like so much time into these things,
[8809.78s -> 8812.26s]  but I could be doing that on things which like,
[8812.90s -> 8816.10s]  I could set a replica of something outside, which I haven't done.
[8816.10s -> 8819.78s]  And like, and the moves are often like pretty interesting as well.
[8819.78s -> 8824.34s]  Like, so I can have that level of specificity and learn,
[8824.34s -> 8829.14s]  like kind of something vaguely similar on a replica as opposed to that.
[8830.10s -> 8834.18s]  So I kind of really backed the replica setting kind of stuff.
[8836.42s -> 8837.86s]  It's felt really helpful for me.
[8837.86s -> 8839.86s]  And I also just really enjoy it.
[8839.86s -> 8840.26s]  It's fun.
[8842.66s -> 8846.34s]  And how do you think about being so specific with your training,
[8846.34s -> 8847.14s]  where you're spending a lot?
[8847.14s -> 8849.30s]  Like, let's take this winter when you're going to spend a lot of time
[8849.30s -> 8850.98s]  on the Burden of Dreams replica.
[8851.94s -> 8855.86s]  How do you think about balancing that focus and specificity
[8855.86s -> 8858.98s]  with making sure that you're not going to get injured
[8858.98s -> 8861.94s]  because you're overdoing it on a very specific set of moves,
[8861.94s -> 8862.66s]  if that makes sense?
[8862.66s -> 8866.50s]  Like, that's something that would be probably concerning to me
[8866.58s -> 8870.34s]  if I was thinking about just hammering a certain boulder problem in training.
[8870.90s -> 8871.94s]  Yeah. How do you think about that?
[8872.66s -> 8876.58s]  Yeah. So like, I say, like, I do a lot of work on replicas.
[8876.58s -> 8879.38s]  Like, I don't solely climb, like,
[8879.38s -> 8880.98s]  times when I have climbed on a replica,
[8880.98s -> 8882.58s]  I wouldn't have all my sessions like that.
[8883.22s -> 8886.66s]  I'd usually have it varied, but like, I'd have some consistency.
[8886.66s -> 8889.38s]  So like, I'd try and do like once a week or something.
[8889.94s -> 8892.82s]  But I wouldn't just be like day on day off, just like on the replica.
[8894.42s -> 8895.06s]  Gotcha.
[8895.06s -> 8898.42s]  So I like maintain some like training structure.
[8899.22s -> 8900.90s]  I've found that that has helped.
[8900.90s -> 8903.70s]  I also found like setting your own,
[8903.70s -> 8908.50s]  you have the opportunity to comfortize the things
[8908.50s -> 8910.50s]  which can be like feel tweaky
[8910.50s -> 8914.82s]  or like the things which feel risky or uncomfortable.
[8914.82s -> 8919.22s]  Like you can kind of make slightly friendlier versions,
[8919.22s -> 8922.42s]  which you can like kind of practice the movements on bigger holds
[8922.42s -> 8926.66s]  or like slightly more comfortable holds or whatever.
[8926.66s -> 8928.18s]  And I found that's quite helpful.
[8928.18s -> 8930.42s]  So like the movement is familiar,
[8930.42s -> 8935.30s]  but the kind of like maybe brutality of them isn't always the same.
[8936.58s -> 8937.54s]  I don't know if that makes sense.
[8938.82s -> 8939.86s]  Well, that makes perfect sense.
[8939.86s -> 8940.58s]  That's great, man.
[8941.30s -> 8944.34s]  Anything else that we should talk about with Burden before we move on?
[8945.86s -> 8948.50s]  No, I think that's covered many bases.
[8949.38s -> 8949.88s]  Okay.
[8950.50s -> 8952.26s]  You wrote an article about it.
[8952.26s -> 8954.98s]  I'll be, where is that for people?
[8954.98s -> 8956.42s]  I'll be sure to share it in the show notes.
[8956.98s -> 8958.58s]  The one I originally wrote on it.
[8958.58s -> 8960.26s]  So I'll have to find it.
[8960.26s -> 8961.38s]  It's on, I think it's on,
[8963.46s -> 8967.46s]  I was used to be sponsored by my friend Louie's company
[8967.46s -> 8968.82s]  called Catalyst Climbing.
[8968.82s -> 8970.26s]  And I think it's on that.
[8970.26s -> 8972.50s]  But maybe I can send you the link after this.
[8974.02s -> 8974.66s]  Okay.
[8974.66s -> 8976.98s]  Yeah, I wrote to like, it's basically a blog article.
[8977.14s -> 8981.62s]  Which I wrote about that, but yeah, no, it was, it was a fun process.
[8981.62s -> 8984.74s]  I'm looking forward to continuing it when I'm back.
[8986.42s -> 8986.92s]  Nice.
[8988.42s -> 8988.98s]  Awesome.
[8988.98s -> 8989.46s]  Okay.
[8989.46s -> 8991.14s]  Let's talk more about goals in general.
[8991.78s -> 8992.82s]  I thought this was really interesting.
[8992.82s -> 8995.30s]  So you and I had a conversation about goals and goal setting.
[8996.10s -> 9001.94s]  And I just love for you to tell me about your dad as the management consultant
[9001.94s -> 9005.54s]  and how that has played into your thinking about goals and how you set goals.
[9006.98s -> 9007.62s]  Yeah.
[9007.62s -> 9012.66s]  So kind of in everything I've done growing up,
[9013.62s -> 9018.58s]  my dad has, he's been like really supportive
[9018.58s -> 9023.78s]  and has been really encouraged us to be quite specific.
[9023.78s -> 9026.98s]  So if there was something that we really wanted to do,
[9027.62s -> 9030.02s]  rather than just being like, oh, nice, like, kind of like,
[9030.02s -> 9031.78s]  I'll support you in doing that would be like,
[9032.34s -> 9034.58s]  try and make it explicit enough.
[9034.58s -> 9039.22s]  So like, it was like, generally what would happen is
[9039.22s -> 9041.22s]  I'd have an idea of something I want to do.
[9041.22s -> 9044.02s]  And we'd get out like a massive piece of flip chart paper.
[9044.02s -> 9046.58s]  And we'd kind of always like apply the same formula,
[9046.58s -> 9048.10s]  which I still kind of use today, really.
[9049.22s -> 9052.90s]  Of like, well, it would be result, reality and response.
[9052.90s -> 9057.70s]  So he, we'd start at like, kind of really like what success looked like for us.
[9058.66s -> 9061.14s]  Like kind of, yeah, where I really want it to be.
[9061.38s -> 9064.50s]  And kind of, we'd done this in like an academic,
[9066.66s -> 9069.22s]  like we'd done it, I'd done it throughout my studies
[9069.22s -> 9070.66s]  and then in climbing as well.
[9071.54s -> 9074.02s]  It was kind of just in anything in general,
[9074.02s -> 9078.18s]  but climbing, the climbing ones were quite regular.
[9078.18s -> 9079.06s]  We do a few of those.
[9079.86s -> 9084.50s]  And yeah, we'd kind of really lay out something quite measurable
[9084.50s -> 9088.02s]  or something, yeah, very precise anyway.
[9088.02s -> 9091.46s]  And then we'd analyze where I currently was,
[9091.46s -> 9095.94s]  whether that be like the boardroom that I set up
[9095.94s -> 9099.14s]  was like as a result of one of these flip chart papers.
[9099.14s -> 9102.98s]  It was like, currently I can like kind of go to a climb
[9102.98s -> 9106.82s]  or three times a week and that's not enough basically.
[9106.82s -> 9110.26s]  So like, then we'd like discuss the response
[9110.26s -> 9112.66s]  to like try and bridge the gap between our reality
[9112.66s -> 9115.30s]  and the result we were looking to get.
[9115.30s -> 9117.22s]  And then there was always something
[9117.22s -> 9119.70s]  quite like practical to do.
[9120.74s -> 9123.70s]  So that kind of like precise goal setting
[9123.70s -> 9125.54s]  is something that I've been quite familiar with
[9125.54s -> 9127.78s]  since like from quite a young age.
[9128.82s -> 9132.58s]  So I've kind of like always taken that formula
[9132.58s -> 9135.94s]  and like kind of, yeah, I still do it at the moment really.
[9137.22s -> 9139.78s]  And it's felt really helpful.
[9141.14s -> 9144.50s]  It's definitely been different
[9144.50s -> 9146.26s]  stepping away from competitions,
[9146.26s -> 9149.30s]  but there's definitely the time element
[9149.30s -> 9153.38s]  is not a limiting factor so much.
[9153.38s -> 9155.30s]  So I'm still like kind of a bit unsure.
[9155.30s -> 9156.42s]  I don't want to be like,
[9156.42s -> 9158.02s]  I want to do this board about this date
[9158.02s -> 9159.70s]  because in many ways I look at it
[9159.70s -> 9161.46s]  and I'm like, oh, it doesn't really matter.
[9161.46s -> 9164.18s]  Like I don't want to like rush, rush.
[9164.18s -> 9166.90s]  Like I don't want to rush beyond what I'm naturally
[9166.90s -> 9168.90s]  or quite organically motivated for.
[9170.98s -> 9173.78s]  So it is kind of like a bit of complexity to it.
[9173.78s -> 9175.62s]  But generally that like structure
[9175.62s -> 9176.98s]  has maintained consistent.
[9178.34s -> 9178.98s]  That's awesome.
[9178.98s -> 9179.38s]  So, okay.
[9179.38s -> 9181.46s]  So you start with looking at the result.
[9181.46s -> 9182.42s]  This is what I want to do.
[9183.14s -> 9184.26s]  Then you look at the reality.
[9184.26s -> 9185.70s]  This is where I'm at now.
[9185.70s -> 9186.98s]  And then the response is like,
[9186.98s -> 9188.66s]  how do we get from here to there?
[9188.66s -> 9189.86s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9190.50s -> 9192.74s]  Can you, we've already been talking about this a lot,
[9192.74s -> 9195.06s]  but can you just apply that framework
[9195.06s -> 9197.06s]  to Althane for me and just share
[9197.06s -> 9198.34s]  like how you're thinking about
[9199.14s -> 9200.90s]  how you thought about that with this formula?
[9200.90s -> 9201.94s]  Like how you thought about
[9202.90s -> 9204.74s]  the first, the result and then where you were
[9204.74s -> 9207.22s]  and how that informed your replica
[9207.22s -> 9208.26s]  and your training for it?
[9208.26s -> 9209.62s]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[9209.62s -> 9212.50s]  I mean, like there's a complex,
[9212.50s -> 9213.70s]  I've definitely questioned a bit more
[9213.70s -> 9216.74s]  of like a complexity to this specific,
[9217.46s -> 9219.30s]  or like this example in more recent years
[9219.30s -> 9222.18s]  in that like me, like setting the result
[9222.18s -> 9225.14s]  as being like, I want to do Althane.
[9225.14s -> 9226.98s]  It's like a project that's like a result.
[9226.98s -> 9230.18s]  Like I've definitely like questioned
[9230.26s -> 9231.94s]  maybe why it's so important to me
[9232.66s -> 9234.18s]  and not fully understood it.
[9235.14s -> 9237.54s]  This like whole idea of like self-development
[9237.54s -> 9240.66s]  or maybe motivation by mastery
[9240.66s -> 9242.90s]  or whatever that is anyway,
[9242.90s -> 9245.94s]  I haven't fully understood exactly what that is.
[9245.94s -> 9247.78s]  But just from like the goal setting,
[9247.78s -> 9251.78s]  like structure, when I would say like,
[9251.78s -> 9252.90s]  yeah, I want to do this client,
[9252.90s -> 9254.90s]  that would be like understand the result.
[9254.90s -> 9258.74s]  I'd kind of, I guess Althane is a funny one
[9258.74s -> 9259.94s]  in that I initially tried it
[9259.94s -> 9261.94s]  and wasn't expecting to project anything.
[9261.94s -> 9263.54s]  So I didn't go to Switzerland
[9263.54s -> 9265.14s]  knowing it even existed.
[9265.14s -> 9266.90s]  I just tried it and was like,
[9268.18s -> 9270.26s]  oh, like this is really fun.
[9270.26s -> 9271.46s]  Like I kind of didn't,
[9271.46s -> 9273.30s]  even when I started trying it
[9273.30s -> 9274.34s]  for multiple sessions,
[9274.34s -> 9276.34s]  I wasn't like, right, I'm going to project this.
[9276.34s -> 9279.06s]  Like I was trying it because I wanted to try it.
[9279.06s -> 9280.74s]  So it was kind of a bit of an anomaly
[9281.46s -> 9284.10s]  in that I didn't really do any goal setting
[9284.10s -> 9284.66s]  at that point.
[9284.66s -> 9286.34s]  It was just like, right, I want to go try that.
[9286.34s -> 9288.10s]  That's like kind of, I'd had quite a,
[9288.10s -> 9290.02s]  I had quite an open trip plan
[9290.02s -> 9292.34s]  for Switzerland at that time.
[9293.30s -> 9295.38s]  But since getting pretty close,
[9295.38s -> 9296.42s]  I was like, oh, right.
[9296.42s -> 9298.90s]  Like I really enjoyed the whole process.
[9298.90s -> 9301.46s]  I learned so much about the projecting process,
[9301.46s -> 9302.58s]  trying that.
[9302.58s -> 9304.18s]  And it is something that I would like to do.
[9304.90s -> 9307.86s]  And so when I like, was like, oh, well,
[9307.86s -> 9311.38s]  I'll go back in autumn to try and finish this.
[9312.42s -> 9315.94s]  I guess my specific analysis of that was
[9316.02s -> 9318.90s]  what was the limiting factors for me on the climb
[9319.54s -> 9321.54s]  and like kind of what were like the common
[9322.42s -> 9323.54s]  things which went wrong.
[9324.34s -> 9325.62s]  Lots of it is hard to deduce
[9325.62s -> 9327.38s]  because lots of it is like out of your control.
[9327.38s -> 9329.22s]  Like I think a temperature and humidity
[9329.22s -> 9330.50s]  played a big role.
[9330.50s -> 9332.74s]  And so that's all a bit more of a shot in the dark,
[9332.74s -> 9334.58s]  but the things which I could control,
[9334.58s -> 9337.14s]  I was like, oh, like realistically,
[9337.14s -> 9340.26s]  what was happening that I have control over,
[9340.26s -> 9341.38s]  what can I train now?
[9341.94s -> 9344.58s]  And then like adapting,
[9344.58s -> 9346.90s]  I would usually, once I'd set this kind of thing,
[9346.90s -> 9348.58s]  I'd have a discussion with Ollie about it.
[9349.86s -> 9352.74s]  And we'd kind of formulate a load of exercises
[9352.74s -> 9355.62s]  which feel helpful or like target those things
[9355.62s -> 9357.14s]  which feel like they were limitations.
[9357.70s -> 9360.58s]  And then, yeah, and then he'll incorporate
[9360.58s -> 9362.18s]  that into a training plan.
[9362.18s -> 9364.10s]  And we'll just keep communicating
[9364.10s -> 9365.06s]  if it's working well.
[9365.86s -> 9367.86s]  A replica was part of that response
[9369.06s -> 9370.18s]  and it felt helpful.
[9370.18s -> 9375.46s]  So yeah, we'll see if the result comes to fruition.
[9375.46s -> 9379.94s]  But I actually enjoyed the process of it as well.
[9379.94s -> 9381.70s]  Like I set a lot of these goals,
[9381.70s -> 9384.66s]  which especially in competition today,
[9384.66s -> 9387.54s]  I've set a lot which don't come about,
[9387.54s -> 9390.82s]  but I've never really felt like too adverse
[9390.82s -> 9394.34s]  to the possibility of failure for them,
[9394.90s -> 9395.70s]  which is quite nice.
[9395.70s -> 9398.10s]  Do you have any goals outside of climbing right now?
[9401.78s -> 9403.06s]  That's a good question.
[9403.06s -> 9403.86s]  I guess like,
[9406.42s -> 9408.26s]  I've got things that I'd like to,
[9409.62s -> 9411.78s]  I don't think I've set any,
[9411.78s -> 9415.22s]  like with the same framework of goals
[9415.22s -> 9418.02s]  that I would like to do outside of my climbing.
[9418.02s -> 9420.26s]  I feel like climbing is very much a world
[9420.26s -> 9422.02s]  in which I operate at the moment.
[9422.02s -> 9423.30s]  I don't know if it's just me,
[9423.38s -> 9425.30s]  but it's a world in which I operate at the moment.
[9425.30s -> 9426.66s]  I don't know if I always will.
[9427.78s -> 9429.62s]  I just stopped my studies.
[9430.58s -> 9433.86s]  I studied until last year, summer last year
[9435.62s -> 9438.74s]  and decided to go full time with this climbing gig.
[9440.58s -> 9443.30s]  I guess it's kind of within the climbing world,
[9443.30s -> 9444.66s]  but not my own climbing.
[9444.66s -> 9448.58s]  There are things which I would like to do
[9448.58s -> 9450.58s]  or are very important to me,
[9450.58s -> 9454.74s]  but are a lot less measurable
[9454.74s -> 9457.38s]  or kind of not really measurable.
[9459.38s -> 9460.90s]  I've kind of understood
[9461.70s -> 9466.34s]  with becoming quite good at climbing,
[9467.54s -> 9469.86s]  there comes with it a certain amount of influence
[9469.86s -> 9474.58s]  and I kind of have thought quite a lot.
[9474.58s -> 9475.46s]  A lot of this, I think,
[9475.46s -> 9478.18s]  came from a lot of discussions with my dad
[9478.18s -> 9479.14s]  when I was younger as well.
[9479.22s -> 9481.86s]  He's always kind of maybe challenges a lot
[9481.86s -> 9486.66s]  on what we'd like to contribute to the world
[9486.66s -> 9487.78s]  and just the things that we do.
[9489.22s -> 9490.90s]  Climbing's a game in which I operate.
[9491.62s -> 9493.54s]  So I do have definitely questioned a lot
[9493.54s -> 9495.78s]  about the contributions I want to make to that.
[9497.30s -> 9499.14s]  I don't necessarily know whether all of them
[9499.14s -> 9501.86s]  are within climbing itself.
[9503.30s -> 9504.34s]  Obviously I'm a climber,
[9504.34s -> 9506.34s]  but I'd like to hope that I can
[9506.42s -> 9512.18s]  maybe inspire helpful ways of living to people
[9512.18s -> 9514.42s]  which aren't solely climbing related.
[9515.54s -> 9518.26s]  I don't solely hope to inspire people
[9518.26s -> 9520.42s]  to climb harder projects.
[9521.62s -> 9524.74s]  That's nice because I was obviously inspired by that
[9524.74s -> 9526.58s]  and I'm grateful for those who inspired me,
[9526.58s -> 9531.38s]  but I'd kind of hope that I can maybe contribute
[9531.38s -> 9533.38s]  some interesting ideas outside of that as well.
[9534.34s -> 9537.38s]  And I've kind of been working that whole concept.
[9537.38s -> 9540.90s]  I've been working a lot more in recent times.
[9542.82s -> 9545.22s]  I actually just started a podcast with my friend
[9546.50s -> 9547.22s]  not long ago,
[9547.22s -> 9549.30s]  which kind of feels like a nice way
[9549.30s -> 9553.14s]  in which I can communicate ideas I have with people.
[9553.70s -> 9555.14s]  I mean, I'm sure you find this a lot,
[9555.14s -> 9556.26s]  like having a podcast,
[9557.14s -> 9559.30s]  ideas you feel can be valuable
[9559.30s -> 9562.74s]  to contribute to the community.
[9562.74s -> 9564.82s]  It's a really good way of interacting.
[9565.86s -> 9567.78s]  Whereas I don't feel like I've always been able
[9567.78s -> 9568.74s]  to do that so well
[9570.50s -> 9572.42s]  with more like fast paced,
[9572.42s -> 9573.94s]  modern forms of social media,
[9573.94s -> 9576.74s]  they're like Instagrams and stuff.
[9579.06s -> 9580.02s]  So that's been nice.
[9580.02s -> 9581.94s]  And actually more recently,
[9581.94s -> 9586.18s]  even I've just released a magazine
[9586.18s -> 9587.94s]  that I've been working on with a couple of friends,
[9587.94s -> 9589.94s]  which has been quite a big project for me actually.
[9589.94s -> 9592.34s]  But that's felt really valuable
[9592.34s -> 9595.14s]  in that we're all quite like-minded.
[9595.14s -> 9597.38s]  The people I've set that up with,
[9597.38s -> 9598.98s]  there's two others of them.
[9598.98s -> 9601.46s]  And it kind of feels like the content
[9601.46s -> 9602.50s]  we've been able to produce
[9602.50s -> 9606.18s]  has been curated by quite like-minded
[9606.98s -> 9608.98s]  or quite distinct values we've had.
[9608.98s -> 9612.42s]  And so kind of being a bit more considerate about that
[9612.42s -> 9616.58s]  has felt like, yeah, a lot more fulfilling.
[9616.58s -> 9618.02s]  So I don't really know if that's a goal.
[9618.02s -> 9620.02s]  I wouldn't say that's so much a goal,
[9620.02s -> 9623.14s]  but it's something I'm working towards.
[9623.70s -> 9625.22s]  It's very hard to measure.
[9625.22s -> 9626.02s]  That's awesome.
[9626.02s -> 9626.98s]  Yeah, totally.
[9626.98s -> 9627.62s]  I totally relate to that.
[9627.62s -> 9629.06s]  How helpful you are in the world.
[9629.06s -> 9630.58s]  Yeah, yeah, totally.
[9631.38s -> 9634.10s]  Yeah, that resonates really strongly with me.
[9634.10s -> 9635.46s]  I mean, I started this whole thing
[9635.46s -> 9639.14s]  because there was a super geeky performance
[9639.14s -> 9641.06s]  and training oriented climbing podcast
[9641.06s -> 9643.86s]  that didn't exist that I wanted to listen to,
[9643.86s -> 9648.74s]  but it's become such a cool opportunity.
[9648.74s -> 9652.10s]  And in a way, a responsibility, I feel,
[9652.10s -> 9655.22s]  to share different perspectives, different ideas,
[9656.18s -> 9657.54s]  just broaden people's minds,
[9657.54s -> 9659.46s]  open them up and get them thinking about things
[9660.50s -> 9661.54s]  that feel important to me
[9661.54s -> 9663.06s]  or that feel important to my guests.
[9663.06s -> 9665.70s]  And, you know, to draw people in
[9665.70s -> 9667.14s]  with talk about finger training
[9667.14s -> 9669.38s]  and then surprise them by talking about
[9670.66s -> 9672.58s]  environmentalism and travel or whatever it is.
[9672.58s -> 9675.30s]  So I think that's awesome that you're doing that.
[9675.30s -> 9676.18s]  And it's cool.
[9676.18s -> 9678.42s]  So I actually checked out your podcast this morning,
[9678.42s -> 9679.38s]  Careless Talk.
[9679.38s -> 9680.90s]  I'll be sure to link to it in the show notes.
[9681.46s -> 9682.74s]  I loved your cover art.
[9685.22s -> 9685.86s]  Who made that?
[9687.22s -> 9687.94s]  That was Sam.
[9687.94s -> 9689.14s]  We were kind of, I mean,
[9689.14s -> 9692.18s]  inarguing about like what serious cover art
[9692.18s -> 9693.70s]  we could come up with.
[9693.70s -> 9694.82s]  And that was it, yeah.
[9696.90s -> 9698.58s]  I wonder actually if you ended up listening
[9698.58s -> 9699.46s]  to the early ones.
[9699.46s -> 9702.98s]  We've since figured out a bit more
[9702.98s -> 9706.34s]  of a easier audio set up.
[9706.34s -> 9706.74s]  Okay.
[9706.82s -> 9709.06s]  First couple can be quite tricky.
[9709.06s -> 9709.70s]  I haven't.
[9709.70s -> 9711.06s]  No, I mean, it sounds great.
[9711.06s -> 9713.06s]  I just listened to like 15 minutes
[9713.06s -> 9714.90s]  of your conversation with Dave Mason.
[9716.42s -> 9718.26s]  Because he's someone I met years ago.
[9718.26s -> 9721.54s]  I met him in like 2012 with Mina in Joe's Valley.
[9721.54s -> 9724.26s]  And I'd love to have him on the podcast someday.
[9724.26s -> 9725.30s]  So I was checking that one out
[9725.30s -> 9726.50s]  and the audio sounds good.
[9726.50s -> 9727.46s]  Yeah, you guys are doing a good job.
[9727.46s -> 9727.94s]  Oh, nice.
[9727.94s -> 9728.58s]  Yeah, yeah.
[9728.58s -> 9730.74s]  No, it's been a fun process.
[9730.74s -> 9732.42s]  Yeah, no, I like that chat with Dave.
[9733.22s -> 9733.94s]  He's a good man.
[9734.66s -> 9737.30s]  But yeah, with the podcast and the magazine,
[9738.10s -> 9740.02s]  maybe the magazine in particular,
[9740.02s -> 9742.26s]  you said that it's this cool opportunity
[9743.86s -> 9745.30s]  to work with these like-minded people
[9745.30s -> 9746.74s]  that have similar values.
[9746.74s -> 9748.02s]  What are some of those values?
[9748.02s -> 9749.62s]  What are some of the things that you...
[9750.26s -> 9751.94s]  Like I have this kind of trial question
[9751.94s -> 9753.30s]  that I want to start asking people
[9753.30s -> 9754.42s]  maybe in every interview
[9754.42s -> 9757.46s]  and something along the lines of like,
[9757.46s -> 9759.70s]  what's something that feels really important to you
[9760.58s -> 9763.78s]  that you just want people to spend more time thinking
[9763.78s -> 9767.22s]  about whether that's...
[9767.22s -> 9768.18s]  Yeah, that can be anything.
[9768.18s -> 9770.10s]  That can be climbing related or something else.
[9770.10s -> 9771.22s]  I kind of have a guess
[9771.22s -> 9772.42s]  is what it might be with you.
[9772.42s -> 9774.82s]  But yeah, what comes to mind for you?
[9775.62s -> 9778.42s]  No, that's actually funny you asked that.
[9779.30s -> 9782.26s]  I'll get you a copy of this magazine at some point.
[9782.26s -> 9784.18s]  But I actually wrote an article about it,
[9784.18s -> 9788.02s]  which was kind of exactly on those lines.
[9788.74s -> 9791.06s]  You asking like what you want people to think about.
[9791.06s -> 9792.98s]  And over the past few years,
[9792.98s -> 9795.14s]  the thing that I thought a lot about
[9795.14s -> 9797.62s]  was the impact of traveling
[9798.50s -> 9800.18s]  or just like the impacts we have,
[9800.18s -> 9802.10s]  like from an environmental perspective,
[9802.10s -> 9803.70s]  the impacts we have on the world
[9803.70s -> 9805.46s]  and travel being one,
[9805.46s -> 9808.58s]  which is like, I think in climbers in general,
[9809.54s -> 9810.98s]  I know I certainly was.
[9811.86s -> 9814.18s]  I traveled like excessively.
[9814.18s -> 9815.94s]  Maybe excessively is the wrong word.
[9815.94s -> 9817.54s]  But I did so much traveling,
[9817.54s -> 9820.18s]  which was like as an experience, amazing.
[9820.18s -> 9823.30s]  But I just wasn't quite aware of like,
[9824.18s -> 9826.10s]  it wasn't that I wasn't quite aware of the impact.
[9826.10s -> 9828.18s]  It's like I just hadn't really thought about it.
[9828.18s -> 9829.94s]  I was so detached from it.
[9829.94s -> 9830.66s]  Right. Totally.
[9831.94s -> 9833.78s]  And I don't know if I've always communicated it
[9833.78s -> 9835.38s]  too well in the past.
[9836.10s -> 9837.62s]  So in this magazine,
[9838.82s -> 9842.10s]  I tried to capture a bit of like,
[9843.62s -> 9846.82s]  I guess my objective was to try and encourage people
[9846.82s -> 9849.94s]  to really consider what they look for
[9849.94s -> 9851.22s]  in their climbing experiences
[9851.94s -> 9854.90s]  and see how much of what they really look for
[9854.90s -> 9856.74s]  they can find in their locality
[9857.30s -> 9860.10s]  and things which they can't then to consider
[9860.10s -> 9864.82s]  like the impacts of the traveling that we do
[9864.82s -> 9867.54s]  and like maybe like try and further respect
[9867.54s -> 9868.42s]  that traveling.
[9868.42s -> 9870.74s]  So, or like, I don't know,
[9870.74s -> 9872.58s]  there's a big difference between like
[9872.58s -> 9874.98s]  flying to a place for a week,
[9874.98s -> 9876.10s]  four times a year,
[9876.10s -> 9878.34s]  or doing trying to take a month long trip
[9878.34s -> 9879.38s]  once a year or something
[9879.38s -> 9880.66s]  like from a travel perspective,
[9880.66s -> 9882.98s]  it obviously makes a really big difference.
[9882.98s -> 9884.02s]  And I mean, it's obviously,
[9884.58s -> 9885.94s]  maybe that's an extreme example.
[9886.82s -> 9888.66s]  Most people don't have the time for that.
[9888.66s -> 9891.30s]  But it felt like for me,
[9892.02s -> 9893.30s]  that was something I,
[9895.38s -> 9897.06s]  in order to feel credible,
[9897.06s -> 9899.14s]  to make suggestions to people's lives,
[9899.14s -> 9901.06s]  it felt like I really needed to
[9901.06s -> 9903.06s]  somewhat walk the walk myself.
[9904.58s -> 9905.94s]  And I'm not saying that I had,
[9906.66s -> 9908.02s]  I don't like as a climber,
[9908.02s -> 9909.38s]  I don't have that much influence
[9910.10s -> 9911.38s]  over the climbing community.
[9911.38s -> 9912.66s]  Like I think I've just had,
[9913.46s -> 9915.22s]  I've definitely got more than I used to.
[9915.22s -> 9917.30s]  And I think as I've become like
[9918.02s -> 9919.22s]  more known as a climber,
[9920.10s -> 9922.10s]  I've begun to realize that
[9923.62s -> 9926.34s]  I'm not only responsible for my impact on the world,
[9926.34s -> 9929.54s]  but also responsible for the impact of the lifestyle,
[9929.54s -> 9930.42s]  which I advocate.
[9931.38s -> 9932.34s]  Oh, that's cool.
[9932.34s -> 9932.58s]  Yeah.
[9933.30s -> 9937.06s]  So like if I like fly about,
[9937.06s -> 9939.22s]  so I think I noticed it really well.
[9939.22s -> 9939.94s]  I'll explain.
[9939.94s -> 9941.78s]  Yeah, I wrote about this quite a bit,
[9941.78s -> 9944.02s]  but like I was really inspired
[9944.02s -> 9946.34s]  by like some amazing climbers.
[9948.02s -> 9949.46s]  And like, I'm really grateful for that.
[9949.46s -> 9951.14s]  Like this is something I've always been
[9951.14s -> 9952.18s]  quite sensitive towards.
[9952.18s -> 9953.46s]  I never want to appear like
[9954.82s -> 9957.38s]  you guys should all be doing this.
[9957.38s -> 9958.66s]  Like it's not like some like
[9959.94s -> 9964.42s]  self-righteous endeavor I'm trying to embark on.
[9964.74s -> 9967.78s]  And I'm like so grateful to these people
[9967.78s -> 9968.74s]  which inspired me,
[9968.74s -> 9971.70s]  but essentially like I've always looked at like
[9971.70s -> 9974.02s]  videos of people climbing in Colorado
[9974.02s -> 9976.34s]  or South Africa or the Grampians
[9976.34s -> 9979.06s]  and like being like, wow, that's so different
[9979.06s -> 9980.42s]  and so amazing.
[9980.42s -> 9982.74s]  And these people are flipping incredible.
[9982.74s -> 9985.14s]  Like they're living the life.
[9985.14s -> 9986.82s]  And then I started getting better at climbing
[9986.82s -> 9988.18s]  and I started being able to function
[9988.18s -> 9989.54s]  on the boulders they were doing.
[9989.54s -> 9991.22s]  Then I started doing the boulders
[9991.22s -> 9992.34s]  that they were doing.
[9992.34s -> 9993.06s]  And then I was like,
[9994.50s -> 9996.18s]  South Africa, flights are booked.
[9996.18s -> 9997.94s]  Colorado, I'm going.
[9997.94s -> 9999.70s]  I mean, I never went to Grampians,
[9999.70s -> 10000.82s]  but I like kind of,
[10000.82s -> 10002.50s]  it took like the global pandemic
[10002.50s -> 10004.34s]  for me to like stop and be like,
[10004.34s -> 10005.30s]  oh, hang on a minute.
[10006.66s -> 10008.42s]  I was so inspired by these people
[10008.98s -> 10011.62s]  and like that kind of inspiration
[10011.62s -> 10014.26s]  led me to do this lifestyle
[10014.26s -> 10015.22s]  of so much traveling.
[10015.78s -> 10017.78s]  And kind of, it feels like
[10017.78s -> 10019.06s]  I have the opportunity here
[10019.06s -> 10021.46s]  to somewhat like not break that cycle,
[10021.46s -> 10023.06s]  but like I don't necessarily know
[10023.06s -> 10024.58s]  whether I want to contribute
[10024.58s -> 10026.10s]  to that role myself.
[10028.18s -> 10030.58s]  And I'm not saying that I inspire people
[10030.58s -> 10031.62s]  to like the same level
[10031.62s -> 10033.86s]  that Dave Graham or Daniel Woods do,
[10033.86s -> 10035.86s]  but like it feels like
[10035.86s -> 10037.30s]  if I have influence on the world,
[10037.30s -> 10040.10s]  I want to like make the contributions I can
[10040.10s -> 10042.10s]  or try to be helpful.
[10042.10s -> 10044.02s]  And I think like what this is referencing
[10044.90s -> 10046.02s]  to is like,
[10046.02s -> 10047.70s]  I think most people can agree
[10047.70s -> 10050.42s]  that throughout all of like the frustrations
[10050.42s -> 10052.18s]  of like the environmental crisis,
[10052.74s -> 10054.90s]  the lack of a momentum of those
[10054.90s -> 10056.98s]  who have a lot of influence
[10056.98s -> 10058.02s]  is quite annoying.
[10058.02s -> 10062.10s]  So this isn't on like the scale
[10062.10s -> 10064.18s]  of like within climbers.
[10064.18s -> 10065.86s]  I think it's like kind of more people
[10065.86s -> 10067.38s]  who have influence over policy
[10067.38s -> 10068.10s]  and all like,
[10069.62s -> 10071.22s]  I think like the inertia
[10071.22s -> 10072.98s]  of those who have the ability
[10072.98s -> 10074.82s]  to bring about like genuine,
[10074.82s -> 10076.02s]  significant change
[10077.22s -> 10078.66s]  has like somewhat inspired
[10078.66s -> 10080.58s]  like really radical action
[10080.58s -> 10081.86s]  of those who have like
[10081.86s -> 10083.70s]  very little influence themselves,
[10083.70s -> 10086.42s]  just because like it's not changing.
[10086.42s -> 10088.34s]  And it might be the circles
[10088.34s -> 10090.34s]  of people I spend my time with,
[10090.34s -> 10092.10s]  but I see so many
[10092.10s -> 10093.86s]  like really good people
[10094.90s -> 10096.90s]  making massive changes
[10096.90s -> 10097.86s]  to their lifestyle
[10098.66s -> 10099.94s]  in order to like reduce
[10099.94s -> 10102.02s]  their environmental impact.
[10102.02s -> 10103.30s]  And I mean, they do it with a good heart.
[10103.30s -> 10104.58s]  And Dan's a good example.
[10104.58s -> 10105.46s]  Like, I mean,
[10105.46s -> 10107.14s]  he probably won't speak much about it,
[10107.14s -> 10109.62s]  but he got a Tesla way before it's cool.
[10109.62s -> 10110.82s]  And he's just installed,
[10111.70s -> 10113.62s]  he installed a load of solar
[10113.62s -> 10114.50s]  in his house recently.
[10114.50s -> 10116.10s]  So it's running all off electricity
[10116.90s -> 10119.06s]  or mostly off electricity.
[10119.06s -> 10120.34s]  So he's like really aware of it.
[10121.62s -> 10124.02s]  And I know like just like a bunch of people
[10124.02s -> 10126.18s]  who are like making really big changes
[10126.18s -> 10126.90s]  to their lives.
[10127.70s -> 10128.98s]  And like, that's really cool.
[10128.98s -> 10130.18s]  And it makes a difference.
[10130.18s -> 10132.58s]  But like, it's arguable whether like,
[10132.58s -> 10133.46s]  I mean, you're saying
[10133.46s -> 10134.74s]  at the start of the conversation,
[10134.74s -> 10137.38s]  like October is a new August
[10137.38s -> 10139.94s]  in terms of like temperatures.
[10140.90s -> 10142.58s]  That's like, there's a question
[10142.58s -> 10143.70s]  as to whether like,
[10143.70s -> 10144.90s]  it's enough at this point.
[10146.50s -> 10149.70s]  And anyway, it feels to me
[10149.70s -> 10151.06s]  like a load of good people
[10151.06s -> 10152.18s]  end up picking this,
[10152.18s -> 10153.86s]  picking up the slack
[10153.86s -> 10155.78s]  for the neglect of people
[10155.78s -> 10157.06s]  with far more power
[10157.06s -> 10158.98s]  or far more influence.
[10158.98s -> 10159.54s]  And it's like,
[10160.66s -> 10162.50s]  it feels sad to me, that concept.
[10163.30s -> 10166.18s]  And anyway, yeah, all of it
[10166.18s -> 10167.86s]  kind of feels a bit saddening.
[10167.86s -> 10169.38s]  So for me, like,
[10169.38s -> 10173.30s]  I know it's like a bit like philosophical,
[10173.30s -> 10174.90s]  but it felt like
[10175.62s -> 10178.26s]  with me having some influence
[10178.26s -> 10179.86s]  over like perhaps
[10179.86s -> 10181.38s]  like the lifestyle I live
[10181.38s -> 10182.50s]  and like it's somewhat
[10182.50s -> 10183.70s]  influencing other people.
[10184.90s -> 10186.82s]  It felt like if I had
[10186.82s -> 10188.34s]  a contribution to make,
[10188.34s -> 10189.70s]  it felt sad for me
[10189.70s -> 10192.18s]  not to at least make the effort
[10192.26s -> 10194.26s]  to do something helpful.
[10194.90s -> 10196.74s]  And yeah, I mean,
[10198.58s -> 10200.10s]  I feel like I've found a lot more.
[10200.10s -> 10201.78s]  That was kind of the motivation
[10201.78s -> 10204.26s]  of like my travel considerations.
[10204.26s -> 10205.78s]  So I don't really fly anymore
[10205.78s -> 10208.98s]  or like I haven't flown in a while.
[10208.98s -> 10211.38s]  I flew in 2019, I think last,
[10211.38s -> 10214.02s]  but I've made conscious efforts
[10214.02s -> 10217.30s]  to try and reduce that.
[10217.30s -> 10218.90s]  And I'm not saying that
[10218.90s -> 10220.42s]  everyone has to do that, obviously,
[10220.42s -> 10221.78s]  but I feel like I've found
[10222.58s -> 10223.86s]  a lot more fulfillment
[10223.86s -> 10224.82s]  or a lot more value
[10225.86s -> 10228.42s]  in doing things locally
[10228.42s -> 10230.42s]  or doing things that,
[10230.42s -> 10232.02s]  I don't know, it feels like it.
[10232.02s -> 10233.14s]  It's more than just like
[10233.14s -> 10234.90s]  the quality of the climbing itself.
[10234.90s -> 10237.54s]  There's like the experience of it as well
[10237.54s -> 10238.98s]  and just the experience of travel.
[10238.98s -> 10240.58s]  I've definitely learned a lot of things.
[10240.58s -> 10242.34s]  Perhaps I didn't necessarily know
[10242.34s -> 10244.02s]  I was going to find out,
[10244.02s -> 10246.18s]  but it feels like,
[10247.46s -> 10248.42s]  yeah, I don't know.
[10248.42s -> 10249.62s]  I feel like I've mostly said
[10249.62s -> 10250.98s]  what I was going to say,
[10250.98s -> 10253.62s]  but what I'm saying is,
[10253.62s -> 10255.54s]  despite this change to my lifestyle
[10255.54s -> 10256.82s]  in terms of travel,
[10256.82s -> 10258.34s]  it hasn't actually felt at all
[10258.34s -> 10260.10s]  a detriment to my climbing experience,
[10260.10s -> 10260.90s]  which is, I think,
[10260.90s -> 10261.62s]  what I'm trying to say.
[10263.14s -> 10264.50s]  I think there's ways to,
[10265.30s -> 10267.54s]  it gets often presented as like
[10267.54s -> 10268.74s]  you either live your life
[10268.74s -> 10271.14s]  or you take massive devastating
[10271.14s -> 10272.10s]  changes to your life
[10272.10s -> 10274.58s]  and you can't go and do your project
[10274.58s -> 10275.86s]  in South Africa.
[10275.86s -> 10276.74s]  That's not what I'm saying.
[10277.46s -> 10279.54s]  Basically, you can often find things
[10279.54s -> 10280.98s]  you don't necessarily expect
[10280.98s -> 10282.10s]  a lot closer to home.
[10284.90s -> 10286.18s]  I mean, most of your listeners
[10286.18s -> 10287.94s]  are probably based around
[10288.66s -> 10289.86s]  places in America,
[10289.86s -> 10291.86s]  but there's like amazing things there.
[10292.50s -> 10293.46s]  I mean, in the UK,
[10293.46s -> 10295.22s]  I feel so fortunate as well.
[10296.66s -> 10299.22s]  Okay, so that's a long-winded way of saying,
[10299.22s -> 10300.74s]  yeah, the magazine that I've brought out,
[10300.74s -> 10302.02s]  it's called Spotter Magazine,
[10303.70s -> 10306.34s]  but that was definitely
[10307.22s -> 10308.90s]  the thought process,
[10308.90s -> 10310.82s]  like which helped define
[10310.82s -> 10312.98s]  this very distinct value.
[10312.98s -> 10314.82s]  And that was kind of like the thing
[10314.82s -> 10317.54s]  that really drew me into trying to
[10318.34s -> 10320.34s]  produce something that could help
[10320.98s -> 10322.18s]  convey those messages
[10322.18s -> 10323.22s]  through people's stories.
[10324.18s -> 10325.94s]  And then there's a few more different values,
[10325.94s -> 10327.86s]  which we defined as well,
[10327.86s -> 10328.82s]  but has been like,
[10329.38s -> 10330.82s]  for me, that was really what drew me
[10330.82s -> 10333.62s]  to wanting to produce this magazine as well.
[10333.62s -> 10336.10s]  And it's been a really fun process.
[10336.98s -> 10339.30s]  And yeah, hopefully,
[10339.30s -> 10340.34s]  hopefully it can make some,
[10341.70s -> 10344.02s]  or at least get some people to think.
[10345.94s -> 10346.74s]  Well, thanks, man.
[10346.74s -> 10347.94s]  That was a perfect answer.
[10347.94s -> 10349.94s]  I mean, my intention with this question
[10349.94s -> 10350.82s]  is not to have,
[10352.10s -> 10353.70s]  you know, my guest or anybody
[10353.70s -> 10355.78s]  tell anyone else what to value
[10355.78s -> 10356.58s]  or what to think.
[10356.58s -> 10357.30s]  It's just that,
[10357.30s -> 10359.30s]  it's just adding that question mark
[10359.30s -> 10360.90s]  to your, you know, in your case,
[10360.90s -> 10362.10s]  to the traveling experience.
[10362.10s -> 10364.50s]  And it's, that's really perfect because,
[10364.74s -> 10367.62s]  you know, I'm already applying that to myself.
[10367.62s -> 10369.70s]  Like I have for a long time thought,
[10370.42s -> 10371.54s]  I always feel overwhelmed
[10371.54s -> 10372.90s]  when I go to new climbing areas
[10372.90s -> 10374.02s]  because I'm the type of climber
[10374.02s -> 10375.86s]  that wants to check every single box
[10375.86s -> 10376.82s]  in the guidebook, you know,
[10376.82s -> 10377.86s]  like I want to do everything.
[10378.50s -> 10381.22s]  And so I feel really overwhelmed
[10381.22s -> 10383.06s]  at the thought of traveling overseas.
[10383.06s -> 10385.70s]  And I don't feel like I need to necessarily
[10385.70s -> 10387.30s]  because there's so much climbing
[10387.30s -> 10388.58s]  to experience here in the States.
[10388.58s -> 10389.46s]  And I'm so grateful
[10389.46s -> 10391.62s]  that I get to travel around in the van
[10391.62s -> 10393.14s]  and be able to do that.
[10393.30s -> 10394.26s]  But having said that,
[10394.26s -> 10395.78s]  I'm going to sound like a total hypocrite.
[10395.78s -> 10396.98s]  Like I am planning to go
[10396.98s -> 10398.42s]  to Rocklands next summer.
[10398.42s -> 10400.18s]  And I really think there's,
[10400.18s -> 10401.14s]  I'm really excited about that.
[10401.14s -> 10403.46s]  I think there's going to be a ton of value
[10403.46s -> 10406.10s]  in that cultural experience and seeing that.
[10406.98s -> 10408.18s]  But you're already getting me think
[10408.18s -> 10412.10s]  about like how to add that question mark
[10412.10s -> 10413.94s]  of what is the impact of this trip
[10413.94s -> 10415.14s]  to that equation.
[10415.14s -> 10416.90s]  And maybe, I don't know,
[10416.90s -> 10418.10s]  like maybe I'll look into
[10418.10s -> 10420.10s]  how to offset my CO2 for that trip
[10420.10s -> 10421.14s]  and calculate what it's,
[10421.14s -> 10422.34s]  what the impact is going to be.
[10423.14s -> 10423.78s]  Of that, you know,
[10423.78s -> 10425.30s]  that plane ticket to get over there.
[10426.34s -> 10428.50s]  Yeah. And it's a good example as well.
[10428.50s -> 10430.82s]  Like, because I don't want like,
[10430.82s -> 10432.98s]  yeah, I'm not trying to suggest
[10432.98s -> 10435.22s]  like that people don't travel.
[10435.22s -> 10437.46s]  And obviously like these places are amazing.
[10437.46s -> 10438.82s]  And like, I have no doubt
[10438.82s -> 10442.10s]  you'll have a flipping amazing time in Rocklands.
[10442.10s -> 10443.38s]  And like, I don't want,
[10443.38s -> 10444.26s]  I'm never going to be like,
[10444.26s -> 10447.46s]  oh yeah, don't, don't do that.
[10447.46s -> 10449.94s]  Because obviously like,
[10449.94s -> 10452.42s]  I don't want to jeopardize
[10452.42s -> 10454.34s]  any like enriching experiences.
[10454.34s -> 10455.46s]  And also like, it's very like,
[10456.50s -> 10457.22s]  I think it's nice,
[10457.22s -> 10457.86s]  like you were saying,
[10457.86s -> 10458.98s]  putting a question mark
[10458.98s -> 10460.02s]  for people to like think,
[10460.58s -> 10462.98s]  just like to have it as like awareness
[10462.98s -> 10464.50s]  of like the impact that has.
[10465.06s -> 10467.38s]  And maybe it will inspire people to make,
[10467.38s -> 10471.94s]  yeah, have like longer
[10471.94s -> 10474.66s]  or kind of like trips.
[10474.66s -> 10475.46s]  Maybe they're even more
[10475.46s -> 10476.82s]  like just appreciate it more
[10476.82s -> 10479.38s]  to like kind of like really understand
[10479.38s -> 10480.98s]  like the privilege of the travel
[10480.98s -> 10481.62s]  that they've done.
[10481.62s -> 10484.18s]  They can actually like admire
[10484.18s -> 10486.74s]  like the distances they've traveled as well.
[10486.74s -> 10488.90s]  Like it's not saying like, yeah,
[10489.78s -> 10490.42s]  never travel.
[10491.22s -> 10491.72s]  Right.
[10493.14s -> 10493.86s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[10493.86s -> 10496.26s]  But yeah, no, it's an interesting,
[10497.70s -> 10498.74s]  is an interesting point.
[10498.74s -> 10500.66s]  And I kind of am very much aware
[10500.66s -> 10504.42s]  that I can never say to people don't travel
[10504.42s -> 10508.58s]  because obviously like it's amazing too.
[10508.58s -> 10510.34s]  And like, I'm going to continue doing it.
[10510.34s -> 10512.66s]  And my lifestyle is far from perfect.
[10512.66s -> 10515.38s]  Like I travel around in my van,
[10515.38s -> 10516.26s]  which is diesel,
[10516.26s -> 10517.54s]  which is suboptimal.
[10518.50s -> 10521.06s]  But like people are always going to travel.
[10521.06s -> 10522.74s]  I think I just like you're saying,
[10522.74s -> 10523.70s]  put a question mark.
[10523.70s -> 10525.86s]  People kind of like think about
[10525.86s -> 10528.02s]  what you look for your climbing experience,
[10528.02s -> 10530.74s]  look for in your climbing experiences
[10530.74s -> 10532.58s]  and see what you can find locally.
[10532.58s -> 10534.42s]  And when you can't just to like, yeah,
[10536.42s -> 10538.42s]  make your best attempt to like respect
[10538.42s -> 10539.78s]  the distances you do travel.
[10540.50s -> 10541.30s]  That's great, man.
[10541.30s -> 10543.46s]  I mean, one example that popped out to me
[10543.46s -> 10545.38s]  from our first conversation in talking about this,
[10545.38s -> 10546.34s]  I think I'd asked you,
[10546.98s -> 10548.26s]  are you going to come back to the States?
[10548.26s -> 10550.98s]  You know, there's so many hard boulders here now.
[10551.54s -> 10553.30s]  Even since you were here last time,
[10553.30s -> 10554.98s]  there's so many things in the park
[10554.98s -> 10557.06s]  and down in Waco.
[10557.06s -> 10558.90s]  I think you'd be able to just crush
[10558.90s -> 10560.82s]  and be really fun to see you climb here.
[10560.82s -> 10563.06s]  And I think you said something along the lines of,
[10564.18s -> 10566.02s]  well, I'm trying to limit my travel right now.
[10566.02s -> 10568.10s]  So I would love to go back to the States,
[10568.34s -> 10571.14s]  but I think I'll wait until I can just go live there for a year.
[10571.14s -> 10572.26s]  And I thought that was really cool.
[10572.26s -> 10574.90s]  I mean, you're still coming over here.
[10574.90s -> 10576.50s]  You're still planning on experiencing
[10576.50s -> 10577.46s]  a lot of the climbing here,
[10577.46s -> 10578.82s]  but just, you know,
[10578.82s -> 10580.74s]  rather than doing like six,
[10580.74s -> 10583.14s]  two week trips over the next few years,
[10583.14s -> 10585.30s]  kind of saving all that up
[10585.30s -> 10588.34s]  and just taking one plane trip across the ocean
[10588.34s -> 10590.18s]  instead of a bunch of different ones back and forth.
[10591.62s -> 10594.58s]  Yeah, I think it can be so much more immersive as well.
[10595.30s -> 10597.62s]  Like flying is quite a funny thing
[10597.62s -> 10600.34s]  in that you get picked up in one place
[10600.34s -> 10601.38s]  and just dropped in another.
[10601.38s -> 10604.26s]  And you don't really connect so much
[10604.26s -> 10607.14s]  with the journey you've taken,
[10607.14s -> 10608.74s]  like the changing of the scenery.
[10609.94s -> 10611.06s]  In this case, yeah.
[10611.06s -> 10613.06s]  I mean, like you referenced then,
[10613.06s -> 10615.38s]  I would love to come to America again.
[10616.10s -> 10617.78s]  There's so much I want to do out there.
[10617.78s -> 10619.86s]  But yeah, I think I'd probably come
[10619.86s -> 10621.62s]  and live out there for a little bit,
[10621.62s -> 10623.62s]  which I think I will do
[10623.62s -> 10625.14s]  over the next few years at some point.
[10626.10s -> 10628.18s]  I'm kind of really looking forward to that,
[10628.18s -> 10630.74s]  but I think I'll probably get a lot more
[10630.74s -> 10633.06s]  out of it culturally as well,
[10633.06s -> 10634.50s]  as opposed to, like you say,
[10634.50s -> 10637.30s]  like quick trips where you don't really have time
[10637.30s -> 10639.06s]  to think about anything but projects.
[10639.94s -> 10640.44s]  Yeah.
[10642.58s -> 10643.62s]  Well, thanks, Aidan.
[10643.62s -> 10645.46s]  I've been incredibly greedy with you.
[10647.22s -> 10649.22s]  But I really appreciate your time, man.
[10649.22s -> 10650.58s]  This has been so much fun.
[10651.46s -> 10654.50s]  And for everyone listening,
[10654.58s -> 10656.58s]  thank you guys for submitting so many questions.
[10656.58s -> 10659.06s]  I know we covered a number of them
[10659.06s -> 10661.06s]  in just the flow of conversation here.
[10661.06s -> 10663.06s]  So I think what I'll do, Aidan,
[10663.70s -> 10664.82s]  is I'll go through the list.
[10664.82s -> 10666.26s]  I'll kind of organize it in a way
[10666.26s -> 10668.10s]  that hits on the things that we didn't cover
[10668.10s -> 10669.14s]  or expands on the things
[10669.14s -> 10670.58s]  that we only covered briefly.
[10671.30s -> 10672.90s]  And then whenever you're ready,
[10672.90s -> 10675.30s]  maybe when you're back from Switzerland
[10675.30s -> 10677.78s]  or when you have a rainy rest day or something,
[10678.58s -> 10679.46s]  we can do another one
[10679.46s -> 10681.46s]  and we can just tackle a bunch of questions
[10681.46s -> 10682.50s]  from patrons.
[10683.46s -> 10684.90s]  Yeah, that sounds perfect.
[10684.90s -> 10686.42s]  Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to that.
[10686.42s -> 10687.06s]  All right, man.
[10687.78s -> 10688.90s]  But yeah, no, thanks so much
[10688.90s -> 10690.10s]  for taking the time to chat.
[10690.10s -> 10692.34s]  It's really nice to catch up.
[10692.34s -> 10693.14s]  Yeah, super fun.
[10693.14s -> 10694.58s]  Really good to get to know you a little bit.
[10694.58s -> 10698.26s]  And I really enjoyed this conversation.
[10698.26s -> 10699.22s]  And good luck.
[10699.22s -> 10700.10s]  You're leaving in a week?
[10701.14s -> 10702.34s]  Yeah, yeah, that's the plan.
[10702.34s -> 10702.84s]  Okay.
[10703.54s -> 10704.50s]  I'll keep you updated.
[10705.14s -> 10705.54s]  Okay.
[10705.54s -> 10706.98s]  How long is your trip?
[10707.62s -> 10709.30s]  Do you have a planned duration
[10709.30s -> 10711.30s]  or just till the weather turns?
[10712.26s -> 10713.78s]  I think it will be about four weeks.
[10713.78s -> 10716.02s]  I think there's basically so much out there.
[10716.58s -> 10718.10s]  I think it will probably towards the end of that
[10718.10s -> 10719.54s]  be too cold for our fame,
[10719.54s -> 10723.70s]  but there's so much other stuff
[10723.70s -> 10724.74s]  I'd like to try as well.
[10724.74s -> 10727.70s]  So hopefully close some accounts,
[10727.70s -> 10729.06s]  but looking forward to definitely
[10729.06s -> 10730.58s]  opening up some new ones as well.
[10730.58s -> 10731.08s]  Nice.
[10732.10s -> 10732.90s]  Awesome.
[10732.90s -> 10733.62s]  Well, I was going to ask
[10733.62s -> 10734.66s]  if there's any way for people
[10734.66s -> 10736.18s]  to follow along with your trip,
[10736.18s -> 10737.94s]  but I think by the time this comes out,
[10737.94s -> 10739.54s]  you'll probably be just wrapping it up.
[10740.50s -> 10741.14s]  Okay.
[10741.14s -> 10742.74s]  But yeah, I'll share all the things,
[10742.74s -> 10744.10s]  Aidan Roberts in the show notes
[10744.10s -> 10745.86s]  at thenuggetclimbing.com.
[10745.86s -> 10747.14s]  I think I've seen you on Instagram.
