[221.12s -> 222.12s]  Hello friends.
[222.12s -> 226.36s]  Welcome to another episode of the Nugget Climbing Podcast.
[226.36s -> 231.16s]  This is your host, Stephen Dimmitt, and my guest today is Neil Gresham.
[231.16s -> 237.16s]  This guy has been at the cutting edge of British climbing and of coaching for over two decades.
[237.16s -> 239.68s]  Neil is one of those jack-of-all-trades climbers.
[239.68s -> 244.72s]  He has performed at a very high standard in basically all of the disciplines of climbing,
[244.72s -> 250.32s]  from sport climbing to deep water soloing to winter climbing to traditional climbing.
[250.32s -> 255.56s]  He's also got 25 years of coaching experience and is an excellent coach, probably one of
[255.56s -> 261.08s]  the first performance rock climbing coaches to talk about training information in the
[261.08s -> 262.08s]  world.
[262.08s -> 264.04s]  He's been doing it for a very long time.
[264.04s -> 269.52s]  And he's also continued to improve over the course of basically his entire career.
[269.52s -> 272.20s]  That's something we talked about in this conversation.
[272.20s -> 277.76s]  Neil had the greatest spurt of improvement in his own climbing between the ages of 45
[277.76s -> 282.22s]  and 50 and has climbed as hard as 514c.
[282.22s -> 286.52s]  And he recently put up a first ascent of a route called Lexicon in the UK.
[286.52s -> 289.70s]  It's a trad route given the grade of E11.
[289.70s -> 293.52s]  Of course, we talked about that in this conversation and so many other things.
[293.52s -> 294.96s]  Neil's super insightful.
[294.96s -> 297.68s]  He's a really thoughtful and analytical guy.
[297.68s -> 302.44s]  He's got tons of personal training and climbing experience as someone who's been doing it
[302.44s -> 303.60s]  for so long.
[303.60s -> 307.74s]  And he has a lot of great insights because he's been a coach for so long and has noticed
[307.74s -> 309.88s]  a lot of trends.
[309.88s -> 313.60s]  And I know I say this a lot, so it probably doesn't mean anything, but this really was
[313.60s -> 317.44s]  one of my all-time favorite conversations on the podcast.
[317.44s -> 322.04s]  I think no matter who you are listening to this, if you love climbing, there's something
[322.04s -> 324.24s]  in this one for everybody.
[324.24s -> 330.04s]  So without further ado, I hope you enjoy this wide-ranging and very fun conversation
[330.04s -> 331.24s]  with Neil Gresham.
[345.64s -> 347.88s]  Neil, it's great to have you here.
[347.88s -> 350.44s]  I've been really excited about this ever since I talked to Tim.
[350.44s -> 355.36s]  I talked to Tim Emmett a while back and, man, he just told such great stories about
[355.36s -> 359.52s]  you and like you guys live together and some of the stories about the stuff you guys were
[359.52s -> 360.52s]  doing on the gridstone.
[360.52s -> 364.48s]  It's just thrilling, you know, and made me really excited to talk to you.
[364.48s -> 366.32s]  So it's great to have you here.
[366.32s -> 367.32s]  Great to be here.
[367.32s -> 368.32s]  Thanks.
[368.32s -> 369.32s]  Thanks very much for the welcome.
[369.32s -> 374.52s]  It feels a little bit ominous that it's under Tim Emmett's guidance.
[374.52s -> 375.52s]  It's okay.
[375.52s -> 380.28s]  Yeah, I was tempted to outsource the interview to him and just ask all his questions.
[381.12s -> 382.52s]  But I botched it.
[382.52s -> 385.48s]  I forgot to message him until this morning and he hasn't got back to me yet.
[385.48s -> 386.48s]  So we'll see.
[386.48s -> 391.56s]  If he sends me any questions real time, there's a chance we'll get some more Tim in this interview.
[391.56s -> 399.64s]  But I thought, so there's, I have this whole outline in front of me.
[399.64s -> 402.92s]  There's so much that I'm excited to cover with you.
[402.92s -> 408.60s]  A lot of it has to do with your coaching and all these insights that you have, having such
[408.64s -> 412.28s]  a breadth of experience in climbing, you know, being an athlete yourself for so many
[412.28s -> 414.68s]  years and also being a coach for so many years.
[414.68s -> 421.00s]  I think that'll make up the bulk of our conversation, but I want to kick things off with the mythical
[421.00s -> 422.00s]  challenge.
[422.00s -> 424.72s]  I just have a note in front of me that says the mythical challenge.
[424.72s -> 426.00s]  Does that mean anything to you?
[426.00s -> 429.68s]  And can you tell me about the mythical challenge?
[429.68s -> 434.76s]  This is some weird esoteric thing in North Wales that nobody knows about apart from a
[434.76s -> 439.00s]  few people in a pub somewhere in the Welsh Hills.
[439.00s -> 443.12s]  It's just the trifecta, the triple crown they call it.
[443.12s -> 444.12s]  Is it this?
[444.12s -> 445.12s]  Yeah.
[445.12s -> 446.12s]  Yeah.
[446.12s -> 447.12s]  That's it.
[447.12s -> 448.12s]  Yeah.
[448.12s -> 449.12s]  Do you want me to tell you about it?
[449.12s -> 450.12s]  Yeah.
[450.12s -> 451.12s]  I'd love to hear about it.
[451.12s -> 452.12s]  What is the mythical challenge?
[452.12s -> 455.56s]  I mean, is that like the going name for this thing in that region or is that just something
[455.56s -> 456.88s]  that you had called it?
[456.88s -> 457.88s]  All right.
[457.88s -> 458.88s]  Okay.
[458.88s -> 460.72s]  So it was something that was spoken about for ages.
[460.72s -> 465.52s]  I think we're going back to something like 2014, 15 now, but this is something that I'd
[465.52s -> 472.40s]  heard about when I lived over there and local climbers had this idea for doing Jerry's Roof,
[472.40s -> 477.70s]  which is like a classic V9 Moffat boulder problem, connecting that with Lord of the
[477.70s -> 483.72s]  Flies, which is like an E6 Ron Fawcett trad route, kind of up on a mountain crag, quite
[483.72s -> 486.00s]  run out, fairly serious.
[486.00s -> 491.80s]  And then finishing that up with this super classic grade six icefall, central icefall
[491.80s -> 494.04s]  direct that was first climbed by Mick Fowler.
[494.04s -> 498.92s]  And I mean, each three of them are sort of, each three, they're iconic sort of examples
[498.92s -> 499.92s]  of their genre.
[499.92s -> 502.64s]  But the question was, could they all be done in a day?
[502.64s -> 504.56s]  And the grades are not super hard.
[504.56s -> 510.12s]  It was much more about conditions because, you know, really you'd hypothesize that if
[510.16s -> 515.80s]  it was warm enough to do the boulder problem or the trad route, it'd probably be like too
[515.80s -> 516.92s]  warm to do the ice climb.
[516.92s -> 520.00s]  If it's cold enough to do the ice climb, you probably couldn't do the trad route, that
[520.00s -> 521.12s]  type of thing, you know.
[521.12s -> 524.60s]  And sure enough, yeah, it got done by James McAfee.
[524.60s -> 529.84s]  And I was, because it sort of represented a sort of challenge for an all round climber.
[529.84s -> 535.64s]  And I guess I've always, I'm probably one of those, I'm like a sort of jack of all
[535.64s -> 538.12s]  trades, certainly a master of none.
[538.12s -> 542.08s]  And I thought it just, this really inspired me and I thought it was a good sort of opportunity
[542.08s -> 545.24s]  to see if I could sort of pull it all together.
[545.24s -> 549.76s]  But it was quite, yeah, it was quite eventful.
[549.76s -> 553.96s]  Do you want me to tell you what happened?
[553.96s -> 554.96s]  Yes please.
[554.96s -> 555.96s]  Yeah.
[555.96s -> 556.96s]  That's why you're here.
[556.96s -> 557.96s]  When was this?
[557.96s -> 558.96s]  When was this?
[558.96s -> 563.20s]  I think it was 2015, winter 2015.
[563.20s -> 567.60s]  And I charged over to North Wales after I heard that James McAfee had done this.
[567.60s -> 569.16s]  Had you tried it before him?
[569.16s -> 571.84s]  I hadn't, no.
[571.84s -> 576.60s]  And I arranged to meet a couple of up and coming video makers.
[576.60s -> 583.20s]  This guy Lucas Wozzecka and his partner Wojtek Konikowicz, they really wanted to film this.
[583.20s -> 587.32s]  And so I devised a strategy where I was going to start off on the boulder problem on Jerry's
[587.32s -> 588.32s]  Roof.
[588.32s -> 592.04s]  Then I was going to go up to the Lord of the Flies, the trad route, and then finish on
[592.04s -> 593.04s]  the ice route.
[593.04s -> 597.16s]  I'd just got back from Norway, so I was going well on the ice, but I hadn't bouldered
[597.72s -> 598.72s]  for ages.
[598.72s -> 601.60s]  So I was actually most concerned about the boulder problem.
[601.60s -> 607.96s]  So I got up super early and I spent the next or the entire morning failing on Jerry's
[607.96s -> 609.48s]  Roof, the boulder problem.
[609.48s -> 613.64s]  And I basically didn't make it out of the car park because it's like a driving boulder
[613.64s -> 614.64s]  by the side of the road.
[614.64s -> 619.24s]  So it was the most like unadventurous and sort of anticlimactic failure.
[619.24s -> 621.96s]  And I've got these two guys who've come to film and they're stood there with their arms
[621.96s -> 625.96s]  folded going, are we going to get some action here?
[625.96s -> 627.76s]  And they only had one day.
[627.76s -> 631.80s]  So they basically just had to go.
[631.80s -> 637.24s]  So I did actually need, at this point, a little bit of moral support because the weather window,
[637.24s -> 641.44s]  the cold snap wasn't due to last and it was bitterly cold.
[641.44s -> 645.96s]  So it just so happened that Tim Emmons was in the area.
[645.96s -> 649.48s]  And I always remember that Tim, he always had this thing that he could always do Jerry's
[649.48s -> 650.48s]  Roof.
[650.48s -> 651.52s]  It was always his party piece.
[651.52s -> 653.20s]  And so we got up super early.
[653.20s -> 656.84s]  We were there at the boulder, like, you know, seven in the morning, first light, whatever
[656.84s -> 657.84s]  it was.
[657.84s -> 662.64s]  And Tim just like cracked his knuckles and just did it first go without even warming
[662.64s -> 663.64s]  up.
[663.64s -> 666.44s]  And then he went, there you go, easy mate, you know, like that.
[666.44s -> 669.24s]  And of course this sort of riled me a bit.
[669.24s -> 673.44s]  And you know, there's nothing like a bit of competitive spirit with your best buddy, you
[673.44s -> 674.44s]  know.
[674.44s -> 676.08s]  And I thought, oh, I'm not going to be burnt off by Tim here.
[676.08s -> 681.00s]  So that was quite a powerful force and it seemed to kind of get me up the boulder problem.
[681.00s -> 686.64s]  So from then we charged up the hill to go and try Lord of the Flies, this trad route.
[686.64s -> 690.92s]  And it's quite a serious, I mean, to give you some idea, it's like sort of big vertical,
[690.92s -> 697.68s]  like 40, 45 meter wall, 7a plus in sort of standard French wise, but it's protected by
[697.68s -> 700.60s]  the bottom part, at least it's protected by quite small RPs.
[700.60s -> 701.92s]  It's quite serious.
[701.92s -> 706.56s]  And then the last part culminates in this massive run out above Goodgear.
[706.56s -> 712.36s]  But there was basically water running down it because there was a snow bank on the top
[712.36s -> 716.88s]  and there was like, there was literally like, it was running water and a lot of this water
[716.88s -> 717.88s]  was freezing.
[717.88s -> 720.16s]  So there was bits of glass here and there.
[720.16s -> 724.52s]  So I was just, I set off, I got like a third of the way up, I was trying to fiddle in RPs,
[724.52s -> 728.84s]  but my arms just went, my fingers went completely stiff and I just, I was just like fumbling
[728.84s -> 732.84s]  and like, I couldn't place any gear in the crack and I was really concerned about decking
[732.84s -> 733.84s]  out.
[733.84s -> 737.52s]  So I somehow managed to climb down and I just thought, well, that's it, we're not going
[737.52s -> 738.52s]  to continue with this.
[738.52s -> 740.16s]  But Tim was like, no, no, no, let's do it.
[740.16s -> 741.16s]  Let's do it.
[741.16s -> 746.72s]  And he set off up this route, really climbing in the down jacket.
[746.72s -> 748.44s]  He got really high on this route.
[748.44s -> 752.16s]  And at one point he was shaking out on the top run out and he did really well.
[752.16s -> 753.16s]  He got really close.
[753.16s -> 758.40s]  He was running out miles above his gear and he started laughing and I didn't know why,
[758.40s -> 762.60s]  but he was like putting his hand in his chalk bag and scooping out these big shovels of
[762.60s -> 763.60s]  what was like toothpaste.
[763.60s -> 768.20s]  It was literally chalk that was just, that water was just running into his, it was running
[768.20s -> 772.40s]  down the top of his down jacket, out of his down jacket and into his chalk bag.
[772.40s -> 776.12s]  And he was like glopping this toothpaste down that was like landing on my head.
[776.12s -> 783.44s]  And in the end, his elbows just went up and he, he took this like 40, 50 foot lob, but
[783.44s -> 784.68s]  of course he wouldn't let me off.
[784.68s -> 788.32s]  I was like, let's, you know, he was like, you, you, he was like, you know, you, with
[788.32s -> 792.24s]  this sort of compelling enthusiasm that he has, he's like, come on, come on, Gresh, you
[792.24s -> 793.24s]  can do it.
[793.24s -> 794.24s]  You can do it.
[794.24s -> 798.64s]  So I went up and I ended up in the same position as him with the chalk bag full of toothpaste
[798.64s -> 803.68s]  with my elbows up, totally unable to feel my hands or fingers and, and, and taking the
[803.68s -> 807.68s]  same whipper as, as Tim took.
[807.68s -> 809.08s]  That was that day.
[809.08s -> 813.60s]  We had basically one more day left of what looked like cold weather and then it was going
[813.60s -> 814.60s]  to warm up.
[814.60s -> 820.00s]  So I got up the next day and I ended up doing a ring round and getting a climbing partner,
[820.00s -> 824.84s]  this fellow who I'd never met before, this Aussie guy called Robin.
[824.84s -> 830.72s]  And sure enough, I managed to get up Jerry's roof first go, charged up the hill to Lord
[830.72s -> 831.72s]  of the Flies.
[831.72s -> 833.96s]  It was a bit warmer and it had dried out a bit.
[833.96s -> 838.68s]  So I was like, Oh, you know, this is giving me a bit of a stare here, ended up getting
[838.68s -> 839.68s]  to the top of Lord.
[839.68s -> 842.28s]  There was a big snow bank on top, at the top of this run out.
[842.28s -> 847.72s]  And I mean, I'm literally like 25, 30 foot above my gear, I had to mantle into this snow
[847.72s -> 848.72s]  drift.
[849.00s -> 853.00s]  You know, like, you know, like just sort of classic top out that you do, but like groveling
[853.00s -> 854.00s]  into the snow.
[854.00s -> 855.00s]  Yikes.
[855.00s -> 856.00s]  Yeah.
[856.00s -> 861.80s]  Got to the top, charged down the hill, went back to the car, got rid of all the rock climbing
[861.80s -> 865.80s]  gear, picked up the ice climbing gear, went over to the north side of the other side of
[865.80s -> 874.48s]  the valley and up to Central Icefall direct, this three pitch vertical water ice route.
[874.48s -> 878.52s]  It was looking worse for wear and the temperature was really warm.
[878.52s -> 884.48s]  It was really warming up and there were all these stress cracks in it and I was just looking
[884.48s -> 885.48s]  at it.
[885.48s -> 888.92s]  And I mean, bear in mind, I just got back from Norway.
[888.92s -> 890.92s]  I wasn't psyched out by how difficult it was.
[890.92s -> 895.16s]  I thought, I know I can climb this, but I'm really not sure about the condition that it's
[895.16s -> 896.16s]  in.
[896.16s -> 897.16s]  It looks right on the cusp.
[897.16s -> 900.28s]  So I set off up this route, did the first pitch, did the second pitch.
[900.28s -> 905.44s]  I mean, it all went fine because I was, as I say, I was in tune with the ice and I got
[905.44s -> 908.28s]  to the top and I was like, Oh, it just felt amazing.
[909.04s -> 913.44s]  I put quite a bit of effort into this challenge, got to the top, coil in the ropes, victory
[913.44s -> 916.56s]  salute, you know, high five on the top with this guy, Robin.
[916.56s -> 923.00s]  And suddenly there was this almighty crash, like a kind of avalanche-y, sort of Serac
[923.00s -> 926.64s]  Fawley type rumble.
[926.64s -> 931.76s]  And all this, like this big cloud of smoke came up and I just knew, I knew straight away
[931.76s -> 932.76s]  what happened.
[932.76s -> 937.76s]  And I looked at this guy, Robin, and he looked at me and I mean, our faces just went, I mean,
[937.76s -> 940.72s]  his face went white, I'm pretty sure mine did.
[940.72s -> 945.64s]  And we kind of timidly, like little mice, like crept down off the route and like to
[945.64s -> 947.52s]  look and assess the damage.
[947.52s -> 954.04s]  And sure enough, there was this massive, like house-sized pile of ice boulders at the base
[954.04s -> 955.04s]  of the route.
[955.04s -> 956.04s]  Oh my God.
[956.04s -> 958.68s]  And the entire route, the entire route had come down.
[958.68s -> 965.32s]  And it basically came down about four or five minutes after we topped out.
[965.32s -> 966.60s]  Wow.
[966.60s -> 974.04s]  So, I mean, I'm sort of making light of it now, but honestly at the time I wasn't laughing.
[974.04s -> 978.00s]  And it was one of those, definitely one of those moments when you used up one of your
[978.00s -> 981.56s]  nine lives.
[981.56s -> 987.16s]  But also more importantly, I think existentially there was a real, like a proper, you know,
[987.16s -> 991.52s]  I think we all look back on our climbing and we think that was a day when I learned something.
[991.52s -> 994.44s]  That was a day, you know, this was a day when I learned something.
[995.44s -> 1000.48s]  That was a day when I learned the pitfall and the trap of like, you know, this obsessive
[1000.48s -> 1006.28s]  tunnel vision that we climbers often get when we got our eye on the prize, you know.
[1006.28s -> 1014.32s]  And I just committed of just this basic error of, I don't know, I didn't take my eye off
[1014.32s -> 1015.32s]  the conditions.
[1015.32s -> 1019.40s]  I was looking at this thing, but of course I was looking at it through rose-tinted spectacles
[1019.40s -> 1021.16s]  and I was saying, yeah, yeah, you know, it'll be all right.
[1021.16s -> 1022.16s]  It'll be all right.
[1022.16s -> 1025.00s]  And the reason I was saying that is because I wanted to climb it.
[1025.00s -> 1029.88s]  But you know, like when you take a step back, you just think how unimportant was climbing
[1029.88s -> 1030.88s]  that?
[1030.88s -> 1034.44s]  I mean, it's much better to be alive and not have climbed that.
[1034.44s -> 1040.04s]  So really, you know, let the mountains always going to have the last word.
[1040.04s -> 1043.76s]  And that was the day when it reminded me of that.
[1043.76s -> 1047.20s]  Oh man, what a story.
[1047.20s -> 1049.92s]  Yeah, it's, yeah.
[1049.92s -> 1050.92s]  What a lesson to learn.
[1050.92s -> 1051.92s]  And it's, it's interesting.
[1052.68s -> 1056.84s]  I mean, that's like the kind of mode, that's like the darkest expression of that.
[1056.84s -> 1061.32s]  But that happens to all of us in so many ways, you know, like more often for me, it's been
[1061.32s -> 1062.72s]  injury.
[1062.72s -> 1066.48s]  You know, I have some little tweak, like, I know my fingers sore, but I think I can
[1066.48s -> 1067.48s]  do this boulder problem.
[1067.48s -> 1068.76s]  So I'm just going to try it anyway.
[1068.76s -> 1073.16s]  You know, like that's, yeah, there's so many ways where that way of thinking can kind of
[1073.16s -> 1075.24s]  crop up for us.
[1075.24s -> 1077.92s]  When we just started over by Senemie, because we love climbing so much.
[1077.92s -> 1078.92s]  Right, right, right.
[1078.92s -> 1079.92s]  Yeah.
[1079.92s -> 1080.92s]  Yeah.
[1081.40s -> 1084.20s]  And it manifests in all sorts of different ways, doesn't it?
[1084.20s -> 1087.92s]  From ice balls that fall down to finger tendons that go crack.
[1087.92s -> 1088.92s]  Right.
[1088.92s -> 1089.92s]  Yeah.
[1089.92s -> 1090.92s]  Yeah.
[1090.92s -> 1092.92s]  Well, thanks for that story, man.
[1092.92s -> 1095.92s]  That's a hell of a story.
[1095.92s -> 1096.92s]  Oh my gosh.
[1096.92s -> 1097.92s]  Yeah.
[1097.92s -> 1101.64s]  I'm actually really, I don't want to talk about this for too long because it just is
[1101.64s -> 1104.00s]  so different and interesting to me.
[1104.00s -> 1109.60s]  I could ask you questions about it for hours, but what is it about a challenge like that
[1109.60s -> 1110.76s]  that speaks to you?
[1111.60s -> 1115.32s]  Because I don't have that, you know, like, and that seems like something that's somewhat
[1115.32s -> 1117.08s]  particular to the UK.
[1117.08s -> 1120.24s]  You know, I had a really similar conversation with Dave McLeod about some of the linkups
[1120.24s -> 1123.64s]  that he's done, and I just don't get it.
[1123.64s -> 1125.72s]  Like, it sounds like a lot of suffering.
[1125.72s -> 1130.56s]  It doesn't really, it isn't what climbing is for me.
[1130.56s -> 1132.04s]  It isn't what I love about climbing.
[1132.04s -> 1139.24s]  You know, it's such a far cry from being interested in like overcoming a really difficult move
[1139.24s -> 1142.68s]  that feels impossible and trying to turn that into something that feels graceful and
[1142.68s -> 1143.68s]  possible.
[1143.68s -> 1147.04s]  So, what is it about a challenge like that that spoke to you?
[1147.04s -> 1152.60s]  Well, I enjoy that too, you know, picking a hard move or a series of hard moves and
[1152.60s -> 1157.72s]  just focusing on the pure physical difficulty of it all without, you know, having any type
[1157.72s -> 1160.64s]  of sufferfest or any, you know, dangerous element.
[1160.64s -> 1162.20s]  I love that too.
[1162.20s -> 1168.48s]  And I feel that it really, I mean, they say, you know, you don't pick the projects, they
[1168.72s -> 1169.72s]  pick you.
[1169.72s -> 1173.68s]  And it really does depend what kind of mood you're in at the time.
[1173.68s -> 1178.72s]  But I just feel, because I've been climbing probably a pretty long time, 40 odd years,
[1178.72s -> 1183.60s]  I think if I just pursued one type of challenge, I could have stagnated, you know, whether
[1183.60s -> 1185.32s]  mentally or physically or both.
[1185.32s -> 1192.96s]  I mean, if it's just about pure physical performance or like power output, you know, I'm not sure
[1192.96s -> 1196.88s]  if I would have been able to sustain it, but because I've almost flitted, or I have, you
[1196.88s -> 1202.08s]  know, over the years flitted between sport climbing, trad climbing, deep water soloing,
[1202.08s -> 1207.76s]  ice climbing, whatever it might be, you know, like if I push myself really hard physically,
[1207.76s -> 1212.80s]  usually I rebound off the back of that and think, right, okay, well now I just want to
[1212.80s -> 1216.56s]  have an adventure where it's not so much about physical difficulty.
[1216.56s -> 1221.56s]  It's probably more about finding myself in hair raising situations like the one I just
[1221.56s -> 1222.56s]  described.
[1222.56s -> 1225.96s]  It's like a sort of cyclical thing for me.
[1226.04s -> 1227.04s]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[1227.04s -> 1231.00s]  I'm actually always interested in that too, with people like you who identify as more
[1231.00s -> 1232.92s]  of a jack-of-all-trades.
[1232.92s -> 1237.24s]  I'm always curious, like, do you think, because you're also interested in performance climbing
[1237.24s -> 1239.08s]  and you've climbed really, really hard grades.
[1239.08s -> 1241.48s]  You've climbed 14c, I believe.
[1241.48s -> 1247.96s]  Do you think that cyclical approach to climbing has served you in your pursuit of just harder
[1247.96s -> 1253.24s]  climbing or do you think you could have climbed 9a if you had focused all in on bouldering
[1253.24s -> 1256.12s]  and sport climbing and things like that?
[1256.12s -> 1261.24s]  We have this strange upside down, like sort of topsy-turvy demographic in climbing that
[1261.24s -> 1268.00s]  the sort of Benjamin Button effect, you know, like when we see Olympic gymnasts being like,
[1268.00s -> 1273.36s]  you know, retiring at the age of 18 or, you know, ballet dancers and, you know, so most
[1273.36s -> 1278.40s]  other sports, you know, having kind of so-called professional athletes in their late forties
[1278.40s -> 1281.80s]  or fifties, you just don't really hear of it.
[1282.52s -> 1283.72s]  What is it about climbing?
[1283.72s -> 1288.60s]  I mean, you could theorize that it's the high skill element, but, you know, there's
[1288.60s -> 1297.88s]  a high skill element in ballet and gymnastics, but, you know, I feel like I've made improvements,
[1297.88s -> 1302.92s]  not just because I've learned tricks and, you know, gained experience and my techniques
[1302.92s -> 1303.32s]  improved.
[1303.32s -> 1308.04s]  I mean, I feel like, I mean, well, I have got stronger in my late forties.
[1308.04s -> 1310.28s]  You know, I've got the benchmarks to prove it.
[1310.28s -> 1312.68s]  I mean, the hangboard never lies.
[1314.92s -> 1319.00s]  So, yeah, I mean, I went up a bunch of grades.
[1319.00s -> 1323.08s]  I mean, the biggest spike I've had in my climbing career has been in the last five years and
[1323.08s -> 1330.44s]  in between the age of 45 and 50, I went up two sport grades and one trad grade.
[1330.44s -> 1337.88s]  And I feel like whether or not I'd climb, you know, isn't it easy in climbing to say,
[1337.88s -> 1341.08s]  oh, you know, yeah, I probably could do that or something.
[1341.08s -> 1346.20s]  But I, over the years would never have been tempted.
[1346.20s -> 1350.68s]  I would never, I could never have said to myself, oh, I'm sure I could on site 8A.
[1350.68s -> 1353.00s]  So I don't really need to do it to prove it to myself.
[1353.00s -> 1356.92s]  I had to on site 8A to prove to myself that I could do it.
[1356.92s -> 1359.00s]  And it was the same with like red pointing 8C.
[1359.56s -> 1363.00s]  A good friend of mine, Gaz Parry, like goaded me at the age of 45.
[1363.00s -> 1366.04s]  He was like, oh, Gresh, you know, you better climb 8C or you're not going to do it, are
[1366.04s -> 1366.28s]  you?
[1366.28s -> 1367.88s]  And like, you know, come on.
[1367.88s -> 1374.28s]  And I wasn't able to turn around to Gaz Parry at that stage and say, you know, I could do
[1374.28s -> 1374.44s]  it.
[1374.44s -> 1378.68s]  I don't need to prove it to him or me, you know, because I didn't think I could.
[1378.68s -> 1383.88s]  I wasn't sure I had to go through that process of self-discovery to do it.
[1383.88s -> 1389.16s]  But having hit 8C and then, you know, quickly afterwards hitting 8C plus and feeling like
[1389.16s -> 1395.08s]  I was on a sort of an exponential curve in my climbing on a real like riding crest of
[1395.08s -> 1401.32s]  a wave, I just feel like I could say that if I just kept going with it, I would have
[1401.32s -> 1409.08s]  got to 9A almost to the point, in fact, to the point where I'm not, it's not like burning
[1409.08s -> 1412.12s]  a hole in, you know, in the back of my brain.
[1412.12s -> 1418.04s]  It's not, I don't feel, even though obviously 9A is an important watershed, I don't feel
[1418.04s -> 1421.32s]  desperate to go out and prove that to myself because I feel like I know what it is I'd
[1421.32s -> 1423.00s]  have to do in order to do it.
[1423.48s -> 1429.08s]  And it's much more down to the externals, you know, the things which people never talk
[1429.08s -> 1431.64s]  about in training books or anything like that.
[1431.64s -> 1435.40s]  You know, it's, it's really the, all the other stuff that's going on in your life.
[1436.84s -> 1439.08s]  I mean, we're all under pressure at the moment.
[1439.96s -> 1442.36s]  We have different pressures at different stages in life.
[1442.36s -> 1445.88s]  You know, young people are under a lot of pressure and I don't want to in any way suggest
[1445.88s -> 1447.00s]  that, oh, cause I'm an old guy.
[1447.00s -> 1448.12s]  I've got more on my hands.
[1448.12s -> 1449.48s]  You know, we've all got a lot on our hands.
[1449.56s -> 1454.76s]  But, you know, when you're someone, you're my age, you're thinking a lot about finances,
[1454.76s -> 1455.96s]  providing for your family.
[1456.60s -> 1461.08s]  You're thinking about, you know, your kind of security for everyone that you live with
[1461.08s -> 1464.52s]  and you're thinking about time with your kids.
[1464.52s -> 1469.08s]  You know, you don't want to be one of these like, again, like tunnel vision climber trying
[1469.08s -> 1475.00s]  the next project when your kids are, I mean, as mine are like six and eight years old,
[1475.00s -> 1477.00s]  you know, they want their dad around, you know.
[1477.00s -> 1483.08s]  So am I going to just go and climb 9a like bloody mindedly, you know, to the point where
[1483.08s -> 1486.20s]  I would sort of potentially jeopardize those things.
[1486.20s -> 1493.48s]  You know, I also think, and I wondered if I would ever reach the point in climbing where
[1493.48s -> 1495.64s]  I kind of felt satisfied with what I'd done.
[1495.64s -> 1504.52s]  And I think I just feel like that now, you know, and I feel quite liberated as a result
[1504.52s -> 1512.28s]  of that because all my life I've been driven by the next project, the next design, the
[1512.28s -> 1517.48s]  next, like, you know, the urge to go one better, one bigger, one better, you know, just keep
[1517.48s -> 1517.88s]  going.
[1517.88s -> 1521.40s]  The next one, the next one, never satisfied.
[1521.40s -> 1524.52s]  You know, I think, I think I feel differently now.
[1524.52s -> 1525.32s]  I do, I do.
[1526.44s -> 1528.84s]  Yeah, that, that's really interesting actually.
[1528.84s -> 1535.00s]  And that's really encouraging to hear because I think we all hope to arrive at a place like
[1535.00s -> 1535.80s]  that, you know what I mean?
[1535.80s -> 1540.36s]  As much as it's about, I've talked about this a lot, like realizing that this journey is
[1540.36s -> 1545.40s]  about the process and enjoying the journey part of it and not just looking for fulfillment
[1545.40s -> 1549.48s]  in those achievements that come along the way, hopefully, because they're never enough,
[1549.48s -> 1552.12s]  you know, there's always the next one and the bar always moves.
[1553.00s -> 1558.84s]  So, I'm, I'm excited to continue to fall in love with hard things, hard objectives
[1558.84s -> 1563.16s]  and enjoy that process and enjoy what that process gives to me in my life.
[1563.16s -> 1568.04s]  But I also hope that when I'm 50, I feel a little bit more satisfied than I do now,
[1568.04s -> 1568.52s]  certainly.
[1568.52s -> 1570.04s]  So, that's really cool to hear.
[1570.04s -> 1577.16s]  And I'm curious, did that come from a certain achievement or a maturing or what do you think
[1577.16s -> 1578.04s]  caused that shift?
[1578.60s -> 1582.36s]  I think climbing Lexicon last year was a major part of that.
[1582.36s -> 1588.60s]  I felt like I'd put, that was the route that caused me to, that forced me to put together
[1588.60s -> 1592.52s]  everything I'd learned to, to summon all the tricks that were in the toolbox and find
[1592.52s -> 1596.28s]  a few more and just go for the really deep dive.
[1596.92s -> 1600.68s]  You know, I just wonder, I mean, God, it is amazing.
[1600.68s -> 1605.16s]  I was going to say like, you know, how many Olympic golds can, can a certain athlete win?
[1605.16s -> 1606.76s]  And the answer is quite a lot.
[1607.72s -> 1609.56s]  A lot of them keep coming back and doing it.
[1609.56s -> 1614.92s]  But, you know, for me, that was my one sort of shot at anything that felt like, like it
[1614.92s -> 1621.32s]  was the one time when I, I did actually give everything to, to my climbing because normally
[1621.32s -> 1626.84s]  there are these external factors, you know, having to, I mean, I, I cleared, I cleared
[1626.84s -> 1631.72s]  a complete pathway for that so that my entire life was devoted to it.
[1631.72s -> 1633.16s]  And I just don't think I could do that again.
[1633.48s -> 1640.36s]  Um, you know, so I, I've kind of had to say, there's not going to be another lexicon.
[1640.36s -> 1643.56s]  And, you know, the important thing is to be content with that.
[1644.60s -> 1651.00s]  So I think doing that route was, was really, um, it was the, it was the high point.
[1651.00s -> 1653.24s]  And I just have to acknowledge that.
[1653.24s -> 1653.96s]  That's really cool.
[1653.96s -> 1659.08s]  I actually, I watched your film yesterday in preparation for this conversation.
[1659.16s -> 1663.72s]  I had, I'd seen the trailer and I had a whole conversation with Steve McClure about it as
[1663.72s -> 1666.36s]  well because he ended up repeating it shortly after you did it.
[1667.00s -> 1668.28s]  But I hadn't watched the whole film yet.
[1668.28s -> 1672.92s]  So I watched that yesterday and I mean, my palms are still sweating like 12 hours later.
[1672.92s -> 1677.24s]  So, but it's cool because you said that like you, you topped out the route and there was
[1677.24s -> 1681.88s]  this really beautiful, heart-wrenching, emotional moment.
[1681.88s -> 1685.48s]  And you said something along those lines, like, I think I'm done.
[1685.48s -> 1690.44s]  And, you know, not with climbing, but like, I'm done with, with chasing, you know, big,
[1690.44s -> 1694.44s]  scary, dangerous objectives, or at least really difficult objectives like that one.
[1695.24s -> 1698.44s]  So, yeah, that's amazing to hear that that's had some staying power for you.
[1698.44s -> 1700.36s]  And it's really brought this, this shift.
[1700.36s -> 1700.84s]  Exactly.
[1700.84s -> 1703.80s]  Cause I suppose it's all very well to say those things when you're stood on top of the
[1703.80s -> 1707.72s]  climb, but like, how do you feel six months down the line?
[1707.72s -> 1710.12s]  And the answer is, I feel exactly the same way.
[1710.44s -> 1711.64s]  I just knew.
[1711.64s -> 1715.48s]  And I think I also knew before I sent it as well.
[1716.60s -> 1722.92s]  I kind of felt, I can't, cause like, it really is type two fun, isn't it?
[1722.92s -> 1730.04s]  Like pushing projects, I think pushing anything to that sort of level, you can get into quite
[1730.04s -> 1735.48s]  a strange, like sort of detached, isolated headspace, you know, you're in, you're operating
[1735.48s -> 1736.68s]  in your echo chamber.
[1737.24s -> 1739.40s]  Um, I was doing Lexicon.
[1739.40s -> 1741.88s]  I was working, I was training for it during the Olympics.
[1741.88s -> 1746.44s]  I was listening to a lot of the interviews, watching the Olympics on TV when I was doing
[1746.44s -> 1748.52s]  these like stretching sessions and rehab sessions.
[1748.52s -> 1753.40s]  And there was one athlete who said she had really mixed emotions about the gold that
[1753.40s -> 1753.88s]  she'd won.
[1753.88s -> 1757.96s]  And she described the process of preparing for it as dehumanizing.
[1757.96s -> 1761.48s]  And she said, having won the gold, she felt more like a real person.
[1761.48s -> 1763.16s]  And I know exactly what she meant.
[1763.72s -> 1765.48s]  You almost become like a robot.
[1765.56s -> 1768.92s]  You don't think you're, it's, you're a series of sliders.
[1769.48s -> 1770.84s]  Where's my half crimp?
[1770.84s -> 1772.60s]  Where's my, where's my drag?
[1772.60s -> 1773.88s]  Where's my lock off?
[1773.88s -> 1776.28s]  You know, like, where's my flexibility?
[1776.28s -> 1778.36s]  How many laps of what can I do with this circuit?
[1778.36s -> 1779.40s]  With how much rest?
[1779.40s -> 1780.60s]  Can I reduce the rest?
[1780.60s -> 1780.92s]  No.
[1780.92s -> 1781.56s]  Okay.
[1781.56s -> 1782.60s]  What's my diet like?
[1782.60s -> 1783.48s]  What am I eating today?
[1783.48s -> 1784.04s]  La la la.
[1784.04s -> 1786.44s]  You know, you, you, you stop thinking of yourself as a person.
[1788.20s -> 1789.24s]  It's pretty full on.
[1789.24s -> 1791.64s]  I mean, it's fascinating and I love it.
[1791.64s -> 1797.08s]  And, you know, this is also, of course, the stuff that I draw upon when I coach.
[1797.08s -> 1802.36s]  And I mean, I don't come across many people who go in that deep, but if I ever do,
[1802.36s -> 1806.20s]  then I feel like I've got stuff for them because I've been in that place myself.
[1808.44s -> 1811.88s]  Will you, will you talk a little bit about Lexicon and share a little bit more of the
[1811.88s -> 1816.52s]  context around that one for people that haven't seen the film, haven't heard about the route?
[1816.52s -> 1818.20s]  Cause this was, I mean, it's been a while.
[1818.20s -> 1819.16s]  It was almost a year ago.
[1819.16s -> 1822.12s]  I believe it was last September that you sent the thing.
[1822.12s -> 1823.88s]  But yeah, tell me a little bit about Lexicon.
[1824.68s -> 1828.76s]  So Lexicon is a route in the, in the English Lake district, which is a
[1828.76s -> 1834.20s]  really like picturesque, scenic mountain area in the Northwest of the UK.
[1835.24s -> 1838.76s]  The rock is, it's like a sort of metamorphosed igneous rock.
[1838.76s -> 1840.36s]  It's like rhyolite.
[1840.36s -> 1842.44s]  It's very, very rough, very compact.
[1842.44s -> 1844.68s]  It's got good friction, small edges.
[1844.68s -> 1850.60s]  Very, very it's like to climb on it would be similar to climbing on something like Smith
[1850.60s -> 1855.00s]  rock, you know, just this rough rock with good, with good edges.
[1855.00s -> 1863.56s]  And, and the route Lexicon starts it, well, it, it shares part of a line called impact
[1863.56s -> 1865.40s]  day, which was a Dave Birkett route.
[1865.40s -> 1866.84s]  It was the original route on this wall.
[1867.88s -> 1874.04s]  And it's like a high crag overlooks this beautiful Lake and impact day takes a kind of S shape
[1874.04s -> 1875.64s]  sort of weaving line up the wall.
[1875.64s -> 1881.00s]  If you, if you like, it takes the line of weakness, but it, but the kind of real showcase
[1881.00s -> 1884.84s]  of this particular wall, in my opinion, is the kind of final head wall.
[1884.84s -> 1888.36s]  There's a, there's a break, like as a horror, there's a horizontal break that you can stuff
[1888.36s -> 1890.76s]  with cans about two thirds of the way up.
[1892.04s -> 1894.52s]  And then there's this amazing blank head wall.
[1894.52s -> 1899.88s]  And when I went up to look at impact day, I realized that the kind of main central line
[1899.88s -> 1901.48s]  at the middle of the head wall hadn't been done.
[1902.44s -> 1908.04s]  And I abbed it, it was very dirty, covered in lichens, I brushed all this lichen off
[1908.76s -> 1913.24s]  and I found a bunch of little crimps and little side pools and realized straight away that
[1913.24s -> 1915.64s]  that it was climbable, which was very exciting.
[1916.68s -> 1922.04s]  But impact day, the route to the left is described and that's given the grade of E8.
[1922.04s -> 1925.48s]  And so for those of you who don't know the British grading system, what that means is
[1925.56s -> 1932.92s]  like a French AA or like what's that 13B run out, you know, like big run outs.
[1932.92s -> 1940.52s]  And the run out above the break on the adjacent route impact day is split by a bombproof peg.
[1941.40s -> 1946.36s]  So from the break, you go like 20 feet, clip the peg, and then you go 20 feet again to
[1946.36s -> 1946.76s]  the top.
[1946.76s -> 1949.80s]  And that is still described by a lot of people as run out.
[1949.80s -> 1954.44s]  And a lot of people take big whippers off that route.
[1954.44s -> 1957.24s]  So with lexicon, there's no peg.
[1958.20s -> 1963.48s]  You have to go the whole way up the head wall with no gear.
[1963.48s -> 1971.80s]  So you're basically going like, you know, 40 feet above and it's sustained climbing.
[1972.84s -> 1976.44s]  You could argue that the last move is the crux just because it's endurance based.
[1976.44s -> 1981.40s]  And also the last move is a little bit dynamic and you have to throw for like a slot.
[1981.40s -> 1985.24s]  And you know, like how sometimes when route setters, they stack two holds together, they
[1985.24s -> 1986.52s]  put a little cap on.
[1986.52s -> 1988.68s]  So you have to be accurate.
[1988.68s -> 1991.08s]  And if you're a little bit jittery, you miss.
[1991.08s -> 1995.16s]  So it's basically that move at the top of the run out.
[1995.16s -> 1999.40s]  So even if you got there and you felt totally, you know, you're looking down and your rope's
[1999.40s -> 2002.52s]  going down like, you know, 35 feet.
[2003.48s -> 2008.04s]  And even if you got there and felt strong, you'd still have to basically flick and go
[2008.04s -> 2012.68s]  for this slot and hope that you're, you know, that you're feeling lucky.
[2012.68s -> 2013.24s]  Yeah.
[2013.24s -> 2016.04s]  There's like a little bit of luck precision element to it.
[2016.04s -> 2018.92s]  A little bit of luck and precision to catch this hold.
[2018.92s -> 2026.44s]  And so, yeah, it was a year long kind of campaign for me really.
[2026.44s -> 2033.00s]  But it was off the back of the fact that I climbed 8c+, which I believe is 14c, isn't
[2033.00s -> 2033.24s]  it?
[2033.24s -> 2033.80s]  Correct, yeah.
[2033.80s -> 2037.88s]  I had done that at Malham like three, four years ago.
[2039.16s -> 2043.08s]  And then after that, I thought, right, OK, I've got this new level of sport climbing
[2043.08s -> 2046.20s]  fitness, you know, what am I going to do with it?
[2046.20s -> 2050.44s]  And the answer is because I'd sort of thought I'd given up on hard trad, but I thought,
[2050.44s -> 2056.04s]  well, hang on, if I've gone up two grades on sport, why don't I give trad a go again
[2056.04s -> 2057.16s]  and see what I can do?
[2057.16s -> 2064.28s]  And I ended up doing a new route, a direct finish to one of the lakes' sort of hardest
[2064.28s -> 2066.60s]  E9s, this route called If Six Was Nine.
[2067.24s -> 2071.48s]  It kind of climbs two thirds of the way up this amazing overhanging wall and then it
[2071.48s -> 2074.12s]  traverses off and there's this headwall above.
[2074.12s -> 2079.08s]  Similar idea to lexicon, but the climbing on the headwall is not as hard.
[2079.08s -> 2088.76s]  Anyway, I did this particular route in 2019 and that was like what we Brits would call
[2088.76s -> 2093.72s]  E10, which is like 80 plus 8b, really run out.
[2094.36s -> 2098.28s]  So I felt like I was kind of gathering a bit of momentum with this.
[2099.64s -> 2104.84s]  And then off the back of that was when I found the line of lexicon and I just thought, right,
[2104.84s -> 2107.08s]  I'm really on, I'm on a roll here.
[2107.08s -> 2108.36s]  I've found a great line.
[2109.40s -> 2114.60s]  And of course, you know, you're always full of doubt and you think, well, you know, maybe
[2114.60s -> 2115.48s]  it's not that good.
[2115.48s -> 2116.84s]  Maybe it's not that hard.
[2116.84s -> 2121.88s]  And, you know, Steve McClure was, who's a good friend of mine, was in the lakes, you
[2121.88s -> 2126.04s]  know, he shot me a message and he was like, you know, hey, Gresh, can I come up to Pavey?
[2126.04s -> 2128.36s]  And he ended up checking the route out.
[2128.36s -> 2133.72s]  And, you know, when he, when he popped over the top, you know, he'd had a couple of runs
[2133.72s -> 2139.08s]  on a top rate and his pupils were really dilated and he was just shaking his head.
[2139.08s -> 2143.16s]  You know, he was like, it's one of the best of its kind.
[2143.16s -> 2145.40s]  It's one of the best things I've ever been on.
[2145.40s -> 2149.48s]  And also, you know, he said it's one of the hardest too.
[2149.48s -> 2152.20s]  And he said, cause I didn't know about the grade.
[2152.20s -> 2159.40s]  And he said, I, it feels a pretty similar proposition to some McLeod's iconic E11
[2160.04s -> 2161.80s]  Rhapsody, which Steve has done.
[2162.76s -> 2168.84s]  I knew it wasn't physically as hard as that because Rhapsody is 8c at least, but the fall
[2168.84s -> 2177.24s]  on Rhapsody is more reasonable, let's say, whereas the fall on Lexicon is a lot less
[2177.24s -> 2181.08s]  reasonable after rope stretch and everything else.
[2181.08s -> 2185.40s]  If you, I mean, I should have mentioned, if you fall off the top of Lexicon, you're quite
[2185.40s -> 2187.32s]  likely to touch the ground on rope stretch.
[2188.04s -> 2191.16s]  Whereas with Rhapsody, there's no way you're going to hit the deck.
[2192.20s -> 2196.28s]  Also with Lexicon, because the head wall is overhanging more and the lower wall is
[2196.28s -> 2198.76s]  vertical, you swing in quite hard.
[2198.76s -> 2205.96s]  So not only are you going to fall, you know, 70, 80 feet, you're going to swing in hard
[2205.96s -> 2210.76s]  and you're going to stop, if you're lucky, a meter or two off the deck from the last
[2210.76s -> 2211.72s]  move.
[2211.72s -> 2213.80s]  And that's if the air gets everything right.
[2214.76s -> 2217.00s]  So that's Lexicon.
[2217.96s -> 2224.20s]  Man, and yeah, for people listening, it's mind-blowing to hear that and it's probably
[2224.20s -> 2229.72s]  hard to even believe, but if you watch the film, it's like, there's no hiding this
[2229.72s -> 2230.28s]  thing, you know?
[2230.28s -> 2236.92s]  So this is a 514a, give or take, where if you fall from the last few moves, which is
[2236.92s -> 2242.28s]  the crux because of the endurance component, you're literally going to take like a 70
[2242.28s -> 2245.40s]  foot whipper and almost hit the bottom of the cliff.
[2245.40s -> 2249.08s]  And there's, in fact, footage of Steve McClure going for it.
[2249.08s -> 2253.64s]  And it was just kind of this surprise try where he hadn't really intended to try for
[2253.64s -> 2256.36s]  red point and just kind of got swept up in the moment.
[2257.00s -> 2261.64s]  And he takes the biggest fall I have ever seen.
[2261.64s -> 2266.36s]  I mean, you guys show it in the film like two or three times and it is just like he barely
[2266.36s -> 2267.16s]  fits in the frame.
[2267.16s -> 2271.16s]  The camera's, you know, like quarter mile away or something and he barely fits in the
[2271.16s -> 2271.96s]  entire frame.
[2272.76s -> 2274.28s]  It's just so intense.
[2275.00s -> 2278.36s]  And I wanted to say too that you were talking about the move to the slot, like right at
[2278.36s -> 2281.00s]  the end, the dynamic move with some precision to it.
[2282.12s -> 2287.40s]  And the footage that your videographer got was so good because you can see your face
[2287.40s -> 2292.60s]  when you're going for that move, when you sent the thing and your eyes are just bulging
[2292.60s -> 2293.56s]  and you're holding your breath.
[2293.56s -> 2297.56s]  And I literally held my breath when you were getting towards the top of that thing.
[2297.56s -> 2298.60s]  It was so exciting.
[2299.40s -> 2304.44s]  Man, yeah, because nobody's actually fallen off that move.
[2304.44s -> 2308.28s]  I mean, what's so bizarre is that this route has had four repeats.
[2308.28s -> 2313.88s]  It's had five ascents, but nobody's dropped that last move.
[2315.00s -> 2321.16s]  Steve dropped the move before that and stopped two meters off the deck, but nobody's dropped
[2321.16s -> 2321.96s]  that last move.
[2323.48s -> 2326.68s]  So, you know, and Steve's quite light as well.
[2326.68s -> 2328.28s]  He's quite small and quite light.
[2328.36s -> 2332.52s]  I mean, a heavier, taller climber falling off the last move.
[2332.52s -> 2334.04s]  I mean, who knows?
[2334.04s -> 2338.28s]  It would be close because also the thing is if the belayer pulled the rope tight, that
[2338.28s -> 2339.16s]  would be one thing.
[2339.16s -> 2342.60s]  But like you have to pay a little bit of rope out because it's a dynamic move.
[2342.60s -> 2346.36s]  You know, you don't want the rope piano wire tight for that last move.
[2349.96s -> 2356.20s]  Okay, so this begs the question and it feels almost like a silly question.
[2356.52s -> 2358.12s]  I've watched a lot of the grit films.
[2359.00s -> 2365.72s]  I know that the ethic in the UK is to preserve these adventures on these routes, but people,
[2365.72s -> 2369.80s]  you know, so many people listening to this are from the United States and that would
[2369.80s -> 2370.68s]  never happen.
[2370.68s -> 2376.20s]  Like no one would ever find a line like this and think, cool, I'm going to climb this on
[2376.20s -> 2379.96s]  natural gear and go for this 40 foot run out at the top.
[2380.60s -> 2384.60s]  You know, people would throw five bolts in the thing and it would be this amazing classic
[2384.60s -> 2385.80s]  that would get repeated all the time.
[2385.96s -> 2392.12s]  I have to ask from your perspective, just for context for people listening that don't
[2392.12s -> 2398.28s]  understand this UK ethic, why not throw some bolts in this thing?
[2398.28s -> 2399.96s]  Like what is it behind that?
[2400.92s -> 2405.40s]  First of all, there's some extremely bold stuff in the States.
[2405.40s -> 2410.04s]  It just doesn't necessarily fit the same criteria as British bold trad climbing.
[2410.04s -> 2414.20s]  I mean, you look at some of the highball boulders that you guys are doing.
[2414.28s -> 2415.96s]  I mean, that are like insane.
[2415.96s -> 2417.64s]  They're like higher than gritstone crags.
[2417.64s -> 2419.88s]  I mean, they're just not, we wouldn't call them boulders.
[2419.88s -> 2425.08s]  We call them like E9 or E10, you know, this insane highball stuff gets done.
[2425.08s -> 2430.20s]  But also I think on, look on El Cap, I mean, some of the pitches that get like aid pitches
[2430.20s -> 2435.80s]  that get freed that are still like done on like bad aid gear, like hooks and like copper
[2435.80s -> 2442.76s]  heads and, you know, bits of, you know, some sick pitches on some of the big walls.
[2443.56s -> 2449.64s]  I mean, Dornwall being a case in point, I mean, some super bold stuff, but how, I'm
[2449.64s -> 2450.84s]  going to try and answer your question.
[2450.84s -> 2453.24s]  Like, why is it like this in the UK?
[2454.20s -> 2460.52s]  Okay, so what we don't have many of are so-called mixed routes.
[2460.52s -> 2463.32s]  But by this, I'm not talking about like ice and rock.
[2463.32s -> 2468.92s]  I'm talking about mixed in terms of the gear where you have some trad and some bolts.
[2468.92s -> 2473.32s]  Like you go, for example, to, I don't know, like first place I went to that was like,
[2473.32s -> 2477.40s]  that was Mount Arapalese in Australia, where you, you have like, you'll follow a crack
[2477.40s -> 2481.16s]  and the crack runs out and you get to a blank bit of wall where there'd be a big run out
[2481.16s -> 2483.08s]  and they put a bolt in or two bolts.
[2483.08s -> 2487.16s]  You do the blank bit of wall and then you get to a crack and then you go back to trad again.
[2487.16s -> 2489.80s]  So we don't have many routes like that in the UK.
[2489.80s -> 2491.24s]  It's either or.
[2491.24s -> 2497.32s]  You go to a crag that's a sport crag, pure sport, pure bolts, or it's a trad crag and
[2497.32s -> 2498.28s]  it's pure trad.
[2499.48s -> 2504.28s]  Now, of course, most people think of gritstone, they think of the video hard grit and they
[2504.28s -> 2506.12s]  think, you know, that's insane.
[2506.12s -> 2507.64s]  Why is gritstone so dangerous?
[2507.64s -> 2510.36s]  You know, like, why don't they put bolts in that stuff?
[2510.36s -> 2516.20s]  Well, that video only shows you the really poorly protected routes on gritstone.
[2516.20s -> 2520.04s]  Gritstone is actually, generally speaking, a very, very well protected rock.
[2520.04s -> 2522.12s]  It's very solid, rather like granite.
[2522.12s -> 2525.08s]  It's very compact and there's lots of cracks in it.
[2525.08s -> 2529.88s]  So if you want to go and climb on gritstone, like you can do well protected routes all
[2529.88s -> 2530.36s]  day long.
[2530.92s -> 2535.48s]  But if you want to do one of the blank faces or one of the arrets, it doesn't have much
[2535.48s -> 2536.52s]  gear in it.
[2536.52s -> 2539.16s]  You can't just like change the rules and put a bolt in it.
[2539.16s -> 2540.92s]  You either, you know, this is what I'm saying.
[2540.92s -> 2542.44s]  You don't have to take risks.
[2542.44s -> 2544.68s]  You just don't do the risky lines, you know.
[2544.68s -> 2551.56s]  So, and I really like that because, you know, it does mean that, because I think sometimes
[2551.56s -> 2555.88s]  this type of sort of bold track climbing gets dubbed as being a bit elitist, but it's
[2555.88s -> 2556.92s]  not like that at all.
[2556.92s -> 2562.04s]  If you really want to climb something that's as safe as sport climbing, go to gritstone
[2562.04s -> 2565.72s]  and climb all the routes that have got cracks, you know, but if you want to do something
[2565.72s -> 2567.56s]  a little bit more run out, you can.
[2567.56s -> 2572.12s]  And if you want to do something that's like extremely serious, you can do that as well.
[2572.76s -> 2577.40s]  But what I think worked out quite well was all this was sort of decided back in the kind
[2577.40s -> 2580.12s]  of mid eighties, like roundabout when I started climbing.
[2580.92s -> 2585.40s]  There are a lot of debates, a lot of arguments, which crags should be sport, which crags should
[2585.40s -> 2586.04s]  be trad.
[2586.04s -> 2590.68s]  And basically I think a load of climbers, like opinion leaders, guidebook writers, the
[2590.68s -> 2594.12s]  federation, they all got together and they thrashed it all out.
[2594.12s -> 2597.72s]  And it was literally like trading, you know, okay, you can have that crag for sport.
[2597.72s -> 2599.08s]  We'll have this crag for trad.
[2599.08s -> 2599.40s]  Wow.
[2599.40s -> 2601.64s]  And it all just got worked out.
[2601.64s -> 2606.76s]  And, you know, there's hardly been any arguments about it since.
[2606.76s -> 2608.20s]  That's incredible.
[2608.20s -> 2614.12s]  Basically, I mean, if you put bolts in grit, you're going to be like in serious trouble.
[2615.40s -> 2616.12s]  It ain't going to happen.
[2616.12s -> 2618.12s]  You know, you're not going to do it.
[2618.12s -> 2620.68s]  It's more than your life or climbing career is worth.
[2620.68s -> 2622.44s]  You know, it's just been decided.
[2622.44s -> 2626.92s]  And equally, you know, like lexicon, it's on a high mountain crag.
[2626.92s -> 2630.44s]  And we have a rule in the UK that there's no bolts on high mountain cracks.
[2631.24s -> 2634.84s]  And generally you don't need them because generally the routes are so well protected.
[2635.48s -> 2639.64s]  And sometimes I must say it would be nice to have like bolt belays for convenience,
[2639.64s -> 2641.00s]  but it's not allowed.
[2641.00s -> 2643.16s]  There are no bolts in the mountains.
[2643.96s -> 2648.20s]  And so the crag where lexicon is, there's a whole bunch of like splitter cracks that
[2648.20s -> 2652.68s]  you can go do, or there's some routes that are a little bit more run out and then you
[2652.68s -> 2653.88s]  got routes like lexicon.
[2653.88s -> 2659.64s]  But what you can't do is move the goalposts and stick a bolt in something like lexicon
[2659.64s -> 2661.32s]  just to make it safer for you.
[2662.12s -> 2667.24s]  But the thing is, it's like, I think if you bolted lexicon, it just wouldn't be special.
[2667.24s -> 2672.52s]  I mean, just go to Smith Rock and do to bolt or not to be, or any number of like vertical
[2672.52s -> 2675.24s]  bolted 8B pluses that there are in the world.
[2675.80s -> 2679.16s]  I think what's special about, well, I shouldn't talk about my own route like this.
[2679.16s -> 2684.04s]  I'm getting a bit big headed, but like, you know, hopefully what's like caused a bit of
[2684.04s -> 2687.72s]  a buzz about lexicon is that it's a little bit different.
[2687.72s -> 2693.48s]  You know, it's all the things that you saw in that video that single it out.
[2693.48s -> 2697.24s]  Otherwise it just kind of merges into that sea of sameness.
[2699.48s -> 2700.28s]  Well, thanks for that.
[2700.28s -> 2701.96s]  That's an excellent explanation.
[2701.96s -> 2708.28s]  And I had no idea about the trading and that makes perfect sense because you do have these
[2708.28s -> 2712.12s]  very cut and dry, like this is a sport crag, this is a trad crag, but I never knew that
[2712.12s -> 2712.68s]  backstory.
[2712.68s -> 2713.64s]  That's really interesting.
[2713.88s -> 2716.44s]  But also it like, they obey themes as well.
[2716.44s -> 2722.60s]  Like, I mean, for example, as I said, all high mountain is trad, you know, whereas like
[2723.16s -> 2729.00s]  low level limestone outcrop is usually all sport, you know, it's just, and again, it's
[2729.00s -> 2730.68s]  done by sort of altitude.
[2730.68s -> 2731.88s]  It's done by rock type.
[2731.88s -> 2737.80s]  So, you know, you don't get like weird anomalies, you know, it's, so it kind of obeys these
[2737.80s -> 2738.92s]  themes and it's cool.
[2739.48s -> 2746.36s]  And I mean, the UK it's got, we've got so many different rock types that are climbable.
[2746.36s -> 2751.24s]  I mean, we've even got like slate and all sorts, you know, and it's, we've not got any
[2751.24s -> 2756.76s]  obviously amazing big walls like, you know, Yosemite, but we've got a lot of variety.
[2756.76s -> 2760.52s]  It's each climbing experience in the UK is very different.
[2760.52s -> 2761.02s]  Yeah.
[2761.96s -> 2765.80s]  I have a bunch of great listener questions that I got for you and I want to mix in some
[2765.80s -> 2767.16s]  of them throughout this conversation.
[2767.16s -> 2769.80s]  And this one feels appropriate right now.
[2769.80s -> 2773.72s]  This is a question from Alina and I love this.
[2774.44s -> 2775.72s]  There's a whole story here, I'm sure.
[2775.72s -> 2781.40s]  But Alina asked, I love that you turned to ballet as part of your training for lexicon.
[2782.04s -> 2786.28s]  What other unconventional methods have you tried and have you integrated any of them
[2786.28s -> 2787.24s]  into your coaching?
[2787.80s -> 2792.28s]  So I love that question, but I think first things first, we need to hear about the ballet.
[2792.28s -> 2795.48s]  Tell me about using ballet as training for lexicon.
[2796.44s -> 2796.92s]  Okay.
[2796.92s -> 2803.88s]  So I got to the point where in spite of really revving up my hangboard routine, really revving
[2803.88s -> 2810.28s]  up my nutrition campaign, I felt like my finger strength had probably hit a bit of a plateau,
[2810.28s -> 2811.80s]  but it still wasn't quite enough.
[2812.36s -> 2815.00s]  And there was two moves where I had to high step.
[2816.36s -> 2820.12s]  And in order to high step, you know what it's like to get your foot up.
[2820.12s -> 2821.40s]  You have to lean back a little bit.
[2822.28s -> 2827.56s]  But I figured if I could, and in order to lean back, in order to facilitate this step up,
[2827.56s -> 2830.60s]  you're going to have to hang harder on the holds, you have to pull harder.
[2830.60s -> 2834.36s]  So I was approaching this by like the way all climbers approach things.
[2834.36s -> 2836.68s]  Oh, get more finger strength, pull harder.
[2836.68s -> 2837.96s]  And it's like, well, no, hang on a minute.
[2838.60s -> 2841.08s]  Why don't you just keep your hips in closer to the wall?
[2841.08s -> 2844.68s]  So you're not putting as much force through the finger holds and just develop the ability
[2844.68s -> 2846.04s]  to step right up.
[2846.36s -> 2851.08s]  And I've got to say it really, really was effective.
[2851.08s -> 2854.44s]  I mean, it really did make all the difference.
[2854.44s -> 2859.80s]  And it also, this happened in lockdown too.
[2859.80s -> 2865.72s]  And I guess we were all getting real cabin fever in lockdown and looking perhaps for
[2866.28s -> 2869.72s]  new experiences and also like social contact online.
[2870.68s -> 2878.28s]  And so the sessions I did with Rosie Mackley were primarily about improving my agility
[2878.28s -> 2880.68s]  and leg flexibility so I could step up.
[2880.68s -> 2884.84s]  Also, it was just fantastic to meet Rosie, learn from her.
[2884.84s -> 2889.16s]  I mean, as a coach, I learned from her style of tutoring, which was amazing.
[2889.16s -> 2894.52s]  Also to the feedback that she gave, sharing the experience with the other members of the
[2894.52s -> 2895.32s]  group.
[2895.32s -> 2898.28s]  I mean, I just can't speak highly enough about it.
[2898.36s -> 2902.76s]  I mean, if only we could do, you know, we all have more time to do things like that
[2902.76s -> 2903.56s]  all the time.
[2903.56s -> 2908.76s]  And I do think it's really important to look outside the box.
[2908.76s -> 2913.80s]  And I guess to go back to the other aspect of the question, which is where have I used
[2913.80s -> 2914.84s]  that sort of thing before?
[2915.88s -> 2921.96s]  Well, I mean, really all it was, was going about circle because my mother was a ballet
[2921.96s -> 2926.28s]  and contemporary dance teacher, although she certainly never taught it to me when I was
[2926.28s -> 2928.12s]  young and I never did it when I was young.
[2929.32s -> 2936.20s]  However, when I was fairly like this or not new to coaching, but I'd maybe been coaching
[2936.20s -> 2942.12s]  like five or 10 years, I made these, well, they were DVDs, but now they're just videos
[2942.12s -> 2949.16s]  that are on YouTube about technique, like kind of technique tutorials, these films teach
[2949.16s -> 2953.72s]  things from how to do a rock over, how to do a drop knee, how to do a flag.
[2954.28s -> 2962.76s]  And I definitely looked beyond the climbing world in order to develop a kind of a way
[2962.76s -> 2963.96s]  of teaching these things.
[2963.96s -> 2971.32s]  Because prior to that, I mean, you did, there weren't many people like performance coaching
[2971.32s -> 2974.52s]  and I was looking for sort of information, trying to find out what other people were
[2974.52s -> 2975.32s]  doing.
[2975.32s -> 2976.84s]  There was a lot of information around.
[2976.84s -> 2981.16s]  I mean, we're going back to around about 2000 now, a lot of training information around,
[2981.72s -> 2985.64s]  not much information around about how to coach technique.
[2985.64s -> 2991.16s]  So I actually, it wasn't my mum, but it was another friend of mine who was a dance teacher
[2991.16s -> 2992.20s]  called Karen Russell.
[2993.00s -> 3000.44s]  I went to some of her classes to see how ballet dancers learn and imprint and ingrain moves.
[3001.72s -> 3004.44s]  I also, same with martial arts too.
[3004.44s -> 3009.16s]  And of course, I realized that a lot of it was about drilling and repetition in a way
[3009.16s -> 3015.32s]  that climbers didn't really do because climbing moves are always varying and I realized that
[3015.32s -> 3020.36s]  it was really important to try and replicate partly so I could demonstrate these moves,
[3020.36s -> 3025.64s]  but also so people could practice and learn to create problems that basically had the
[3025.64s -> 3027.80s]  same move and repeated them over and over again.
[3027.80s -> 3029.08s]  So you could drill them.
[3029.08s -> 3037.32s]  And so, yeah, I mean, I drew on other influences back then, but I mean, I could, I don't know,
[3037.32s -> 3038.28s]  how long have we got Steve?
[3038.52s -> 3043.40s]  Well, I think this is just the ballet and dance side of things.
[3045.08s -> 3046.36s]  I want to dig into the other stuff.
[3046.36s -> 3052.20s]  I think this is actually a great opportunity to segue into your coaching, but to kind of
[3052.20s -> 3056.04s]  kick that off, I want to talk about something that we had talked about in our first conversation
[3056.04s -> 3059.72s]  a few weeks ago, which is, you know, you're, are you 50 years old?
[3059.72s -> 3060.20s]  Is that right?
[3061.08s -> 3062.04s]  I'm 51 now.
[3062.04s -> 3062.54s]  51.
[3063.32s -> 3064.52s]  Oh, happy birthday.
[3064.52s -> 3065.02s]  Great.
[3065.02s -> 3065.52s]  Thank you.
[3066.38s -> 3070.94s]  So yeah, you're 51, you've been climbing for 40 years, and you had just mentioned in our
[3070.94s -> 3074.46s]  first conversation that you feel like you've never been a natural, like you've always
[3074.46s -> 3077.50s]  had to work very hard at climbing.
[3077.50s -> 3082.46s]  And I would just love to hear a little bit about what you stand for as a climber and
[3082.46s -> 3085.90s]  coach, you know, like what, how has that influenced your philosophy?
[3087.50s -> 3088.78s]  Well, go ahead.
[3089.58s -> 3094.54s]  You know, I think that's quite a few, you know, you hear good climbers saying this,
[3094.54s -> 3100.06s]  and sometimes it's a little bit of false modesty there, but like, you've really got to trust
[3100.06s -> 3100.70s]  me on this.
[3100.70s -> 3108.46s]  I mean, if I take my eye off the ball, my climbing just drops off a cliff and, you know,
[3108.46s -> 3111.74s]  that's happened more than ever this year.
[3111.74s -> 3117.18s]  I mean, when it comes to the whole like rollercoaster ride of doing projects and peaking,
[3117.18s -> 3120.06s]  like the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[3120.06s -> 3125.02s]  And I knew after doing Lexicon that there was going to be a major crash afterwards.
[3125.02s -> 3131.18s]  And sure enough, I would say that this year is a reminder of like how low my base level
[3131.18s -> 3131.98s]  actually is.
[3131.98s -> 3136.86s]  I mean, if you saw me at the gym now, you'd just say, this guy didn't climb Lexicon or
[3136.86s -> 3142.38s]  at least Lexicon really can't be that hard because I just, my climbing comes down like
[3142.38s -> 3143.42s]  four grades.
[3143.42s -> 3144.70s]  I mean, it really doesn't.
[3145.26s -> 3149.02s]  And, but you know, not a lot, I'm going a little bit off the subject now.
[3149.02s -> 3153.34s]  I'm talking about, sorry, I'm starting to move into like, a lot of climbers will just
[3153.34s -> 3157.90s]  operate a more consistent level because they don't like those highs and lows and those
[3157.90s -> 3158.78s]  fluctuations.
[3158.78s -> 3164.86s]  But I've realized I can get more out of myself by aiming for a peak and then, you know, coming
[3164.86s -> 3167.18s]  down from that peak and aiming for that next one.
[3167.18s -> 3173.02s]  But back to the original question, I mean, I guess this all stems from when I first got
[3173.02s -> 3179.66s]  into climbing and I, I mean, at school, I didn't enjoy sport, was the, I was the kind
[3179.66s -> 3183.34s]  of kid, slightly overweight kid who didn't get picked for any of the teams.
[3184.94s -> 3189.98s]  But then when my dad took me to the, there's some little standstone outcrops just south
[3189.98s -> 3195.34s]  of London and just did these really small, like modest sort of top roping crags.
[3195.34s -> 3202.38s]  And I just, I loved, I just, it was the first touch of the rock was like some sort of electric
[3202.38s -> 3202.94s]  shock.
[3202.94s -> 3208.06s]  You know, I just was, I felt like permanently charged with it.
[3208.06s -> 3211.34s]  And it was just so many things.
[3211.34s -> 3214.62s]  It was, it was the fact that it was non-competitive.
[3214.62s -> 3216.38s]  It was non-judgmental.
[3217.26s -> 3223.98s]  It just felt good to, and I, but I just, I became a red pointer, like a project climber
[3223.98s -> 3226.54s]  right from the start because I couldn't really get up anything.
[3227.10s -> 3229.42s]  I was so inept at it.
[3229.42s -> 3234.62s]  And I remember having these like three or four day sieges to get up things that were
[3234.62s -> 3240.22s]  given like, you know, less than French four plus, you know, on a top rope.
[3240.22s -> 3241.26s]  And they were so easy.
[3241.26s -> 3244.94s]  They weren't even graded, but I just didn't care.
[3244.94s -> 3247.82s]  I just, I just loved, like, just, I mean, I had no technique.
[3247.82s -> 3248.86s]  I had no strength.
[3249.50s -> 3256.78s]  But I just, I was just throwing myself, you know, totally like with this sort of willful
[3256.78s -> 3263.02s]  abandon at these bits of rock and, you know, and, and, and I very quickly kind of just
[3263.02s -> 3267.58s]  became obsessed with it and started reading all the magazines and all the top climbers,
[3267.58s -> 3271.58s]  you know, from the UK and the States and France, they all became my heroes.
[3271.58s -> 3274.46s]  I had pictures of them all over my bedroom wall.
[3274.46s -> 3281.98s]  I was just a total obsessive climbing geek, but never had the slightest, like never had
[3281.98s -> 3287.50s]  my sights set on any hard grades because I was so, so the, the, the, the improvements
[3287.50s -> 3292.70s]  I made was so slow and so incremental that they weren't even, you know, by my mid teens,
[3292.70s -> 3297.50s]  I was still climbing pretty modest grades and, and just didn't think about climbing
[3297.50s -> 3297.90s]  hard.
[3298.86s -> 3303.90s]  I mean, it wasn't until I moved to Sheffield and went to Sheffield university and I started
[3303.90s -> 3308.14s]  like, you know, you, they say that, you know, be careful about meeting your heroes.
[3308.14s -> 3312.70s]  But for me, like meeting climbers like Ben Moon and Jerry Moffat and watching them and
[3312.70s -> 3313.58s]  seeing what they did.
[3315.18s -> 3321.02s]  And a couple of like climbers were influential in that period for me, like sort of past,
[3321.02s -> 3322.94s]  cause there was no information flow back then.
[3322.94s -> 3324.38s]  There was, this was all pre-internet.
[3324.38s -> 3329.02s]  We're talking like, you know, late eighties, early nineties, no one was writing training
[3329.02s -> 3330.46s]  articles for magazines.
[3330.46s -> 3332.70s]  I'm not even sure if Eric Horst's first book was out.
[3332.70s -> 3334.38s]  There was literally no information.
[3335.02s -> 3340.14s]  So the only way you could learn was for me was to move from London to go to Sheffield
[3340.14s -> 3342.30s]  and hope that I would bump into the top climbers.
[3342.30s -> 3343.26s]  And that was what happened.
[3343.82s -> 3344.38s]  Wow.
[3344.38s -> 3349.26s]  And there was a climber called Mark Preti, Zippy, who climbed with Moon and Moffat.
[3350.06s -> 3352.22s]  We see Moon and Moffat were just kind of doing their thing.
[3352.22s -> 3357.90s]  They weren't so much thinking about like sharing any info, but this guy Mark Preti come over
[3357.90s -> 3361.10s]  to me and say, Oh, you know, what's the issue working on?
[3361.10s -> 3363.10s]  And have you thought about doing it this way?
[3363.10s -> 3365.26s]  And you know, what training are you doing?
[3365.26s -> 3369.34s]  And I was like, Oh, I'm doing loads of weight training, you know, to get strong.
[3369.34s -> 3371.26s]  And he was like, weight training.
[3372.38s -> 3373.66s]  You know, he's like, do you boulder?
[3373.66s -> 3378.14s]  I was like, you know, what's, what's bouldering all this sort of thing.
[3378.14s -> 3385.66s]  And, and, and so, you know, and, and so it all started and, and, but I kind of then made
[3385.66s -> 3390.70s]  some really big, like not, no, no, I didn't make big, I think probably started making
[3390.78s -> 3392.70s]  slightly more noticeable improvements.
[3392.70s -> 3397.50s]  And at that stage, and then I kind of got up to the point where I climbed my first 8a.
[3399.10s -> 3399.82s]  In fact, no, I did.
[3399.82s -> 3401.50s]  I just, things suddenly took off.
[3401.50s -> 3403.74s]  Climbed my first 8a when I was like 18.
[3404.62s -> 3410.86s]  And then I started writing training articles because I just thought, I had so much in,
[3410.86s -> 3416.54s]  like, I had learned so many things that immediately benefited my climbing and made someone who
[3417.50s -> 3419.82s]  never thought they were going to climb hard.
[3419.82s -> 3421.98s]  It made, made them, it made them climb hard.
[3421.98s -> 3424.30s]  And I thought, well, this is useful stuff.
[3424.30s -> 3425.90s]  People are going to be interested in this.
[3425.90s -> 3428.14s]  And, and I, and I started writing training articles.
[3429.10s -> 3434.30s]  And then from there, people started asking me for coaching and I, and I sort of went,
[3434.30s -> 3437.66s]  well, you know, I, I, I don't know.
[3438.22s -> 3440.14s]  I'm not, who's a coach?
[3440.14s -> 3441.90s]  Like can climbing be coached?
[3441.90s -> 3443.50s]  There were no climbing coaches.
[3443.50s -> 3447.98s]  There was, you know, what we called instructors, which were, you know, generally thought of
[3447.98s -> 3450.14s]  as people who taught you how to belay and tie in.
[3450.14s -> 3453.98s]  But in terms of anyone who could like actually help you improve, there was, there weren't
[3453.98s -> 3454.78s]  any coaches.
[3455.58s -> 3459.74s]  So I almost got like bullied into it by a few people who said, well, okay.
[3459.74s -> 3461.26s]  And I said, I'm not going to take anyone.
[3461.26s -> 3464.94s]  I'm not going to take anyone's money for this, but I'll, if you're asking me for a
[3464.94s -> 3466.14s]  few tips, I'll have a go.
[3467.18s -> 3468.86s]  And it all kind of started off like that.
[3470.06s -> 3472.86s]  And, uh, and I kind of fell in love with it as well.
[3472.86s -> 3477.50s]  And, you know, because I noticed that the tips I was passing on were helping people
[3477.58s -> 3484.06s]  to improve and, and, and, and it was really very rewarding, but it also had this fantastic
[3484.06s -> 3489.34s]  effect of taking the pressure off my own climbing a little bit, because I'm not just thinking
[3489.34s -> 3494.22s]  about me and my, you know, whether I'm getting strong or not, or whether I'm achieving my
[3494.22s -> 3499.42s]  next grade, you know, it's like, I'm getting, I'm, I'm, I'm really getting the psych off
[3499.42s -> 3501.82s]  back off these people who I'm, who I'm coaching.
[3502.06s -> 3508.30s]  And so over the years, I think it's been a really, a really successful combination for
[3508.30s -> 3513.02s]  me in terms of my motivation, because if there's ever a period where let's say, you
[3513.02s -> 3517.50s]  know, cause we can't be, you know, we can't be smashing it all the time that there has
[3517.50s -> 3521.98s]  to be some periods when, you know, things aren't going so well, but that might just
[3521.98s -> 3525.18s]  coincide with a period where a bunch of clients are smashing it.
[3525.18s -> 3530.54s]  So there's always like, there's always some good stuff going on, you know, um, sorry for
[3530.54s -> 3532.54s]  the long answer, have I gone off on a bit of a tangent?
[3532.54s -> 3537.98s]  No, that's no, I mean, this is exactly why I was so excited to talk to you because, you
[3537.98s -> 3540.78s]  know, I've had a lot of high performers on the show.
[3540.78s -> 3546.30s]  And when you're talking to like a elite professional climber, one of the best, especially when
[3546.30s -> 3551.18s]  they, you know, started as kids and had a coach and a team and all these modern things
[3551.18s -> 3557.18s]  that a lot of these people have, as insightful as many of them are, like, there's just some
[3557.18s -> 3562.38s]  level of self-awareness, not self-awareness, um, there's a level of relatability that
[3562.38s -> 3566.62s]  they're never, never going to have to someone like me or someone like whoever is out there
[3566.62s -> 3570.46s]  listening right now, you know, but, but you climbing has always been hard.
[3570.46s -> 3571.98s]  It's always been a struggle for you.
[3571.98s -> 3577.18s]  And yet you've managed to claw your way up to 14C, which is so inspiring to me.
[3577.18s -> 3580.54s]  And, you know, you've climbed some of your hardest stuff in your late forties and then
[3580.54s -> 3586.86s]  combining that with 25 years of coaching experience or however long, I'm sure that you have so
[3586.86s -> 3592.86s]  many insights to share and so many ideas and tips to pass on to people listening that
[3592.86s -> 3595.50s]  go beyond just the conventional wisdom, right?
[3595.50s -> 3598.78s]  Like we all know that like doing some sort of finger training is probably going to help
[3598.78s -> 3602.38s]  our climbing if that's not already a massive strength of ours.
[3603.02s -> 3604.86s]  But yeah, we've already talked about ballet.
[3604.86s -> 3610.54s]  I mean, I'm really curious what some of the other, like, if you have anything, any other
[3610.54s -> 3616.78s]  ideas in your mind that are like kind of categorically huge opportunities for improvement
[3616.78s -> 3620.14s]  as climbers that people just aren't spending enough time thinking about or putting enough
[3620.14s -> 3620.86s]  energy into?
[3620.86s -> 3622.30s]  Do any things like that come to mind?
[3623.58s -> 3628.14s]  I feel like I'm going to, I'm going to, because we could talk for probably a week about this,
[3628.14s -> 3633.90s]  I've probably got to start in like, and in case people are starting to like, they need
[3633.90s -> 3636.06s]  to switch off this podcast and get on with their day.
[3636.06s -> 3638.62s]  And they're saying, come on Gresham, give us your best shot.
[3639.34s -> 3640.46s]  I haven't got much time.
[3641.74s -> 3648.38s]  The main thing that happens when I coach people, and this has been happening for 25, 30 years,
[3649.02s -> 3655.26s]  is that when you say to someone, you can do that, I believe you can.
[3655.26s -> 3658.22s]  And it's something that they didn't believe that they could do themselves.
[3658.22s -> 3662.46s]  But you say, well, I've looked at you on this other route or on this other boulder problem.
[3662.46s -> 3664.06s]  I've seen your footwork.
[3664.06s -> 3666.94s]  I've seen the way you read the route, seen the way you move.
[3666.94s -> 3668.70s]  I've looked at your strength on the hangboard.
[3668.70s -> 3670.06s]  I've seen you do this, I've seen you do that.
[3670.86s -> 3676.06s]  So to me, it's actually logical that you'll now go and do this next route, this thing
[3676.06s -> 3679.90s]  that you, well, I wouldn't say this, but they, this thing that they don't seem to believe
[3679.90s -> 3680.70s]  that they can do.
[3680.70s -> 3684.70s]  And as soon as you implant that motivation into this person, they go and do it.
[3685.66s -> 3687.98s]  I had two coaching sessions like that last week.
[3687.98s -> 3693.42s]  I just, well, one yesterday, this guy says to me, you know, V6 is pretty much my limit.
[3693.42s -> 3695.90s]  He did three V6s in the session.
[3695.90s -> 3698.30s]  I'm like, you know, he nearly flashed one of them.
[3698.30s -> 3699.90s]  It's like, you're telling me V6 is your limit.
[3699.90s -> 3700.86s]  You can climb V9.
[3701.58s -> 3703.58s]  You know, this happens all the time.
[3703.58s -> 3707.10s]  And I think that people don't realize how hard they can climb.
[3707.10s -> 3712.22s]  And I think a lot of it comes down to initially goal setting.
[3712.22s -> 3715.50s]  I think that a lot of climbers struggle to set goals.
[3715.50s -> 3721.58s]  And sometimes I do think that the goal of just climbing better isn't enough.
[3721.74s -> 3724.86s]  I think you need to look, you need to go deeper than that.
[3724.86s -> 3730.86s]  And you need to connect yourself to clients that are really meaningful for you.
[3730.86s -> 3732.14s]  I think that's very important.
[3733.34s -> 3737.98s]  But then I think when push comes to shove that, yeah, okay, strength's important.
[3737.98s -> 3739.18s]  Technique is very important.
[3739.82s -> 3741.82s]  Tactical approach is very important.
[3741.82s -> 3745.66s]  Mindset we know is important, but like what aspect of mindset is the most important?
[3746.78s -> 3749.66s]  The most important aspect of mindset is finishing game.
[3750.46s -> 3751.18s]  Finishing game.
[3751.58s -> 3753.66s]  You have to finish this thing that you've started.
[3754.30s -> 3757.50s]  We go on Instagram and it's a wash with, here's me on my project.
[3757.50s -> 3758.46s]  Yeah, I've done all the moves.
[3758.46s -> 3760.22s]  Oh yeah, I got some good links today.
[3760.22s -> 3761.10s]  I'm doing quite well.
[3761.90s -> 3765.26s]  But when you look at the climbers who've succeeded, the ones who've done really well,
[3765.26s -> 3767.26s]  they're the ones who finished what they've started.
[3767.26s -> 3768.70s]  It's like a DIY project.
[3768.70s -> 3770.14s]  Like, oh, I'm going to paint the lounge.
[3770.14s -> 3771.34s]  Oh, I'm going to look at the colors.
[3771.34s -> 3772.30s]  Oh, we could do it this color.
[3772.30s -> 3772.94s]  Oh, that's a beauty.
[3774.38s -> 3778.54s]  But like to finish this project is always the hard part
[3778.54s -> 3782.46s]  because it just, the last part is the dirty part.
[3783.50s -> 3791.02s]  Friend of mine, Neil Mawson, there's this like iconic quote that the time when you're most
[3791.02s -> 3794.38s]  likely to give up is the time when you're most likely to do it.
[3795.90s -> 3801.58s]  And so a lot of people just don't get it over the finishing line.
[3802.54s -> 3803.66s]  That's the important thing.
[3804.46s -> 3809.98s]  And if you work on your ability, you see that as an aspect of your climbing performance,
[3809.98s -> 3817.26s]  like your half crimp strength or your endurance or whatever, think of your finishing game as a
[3817.26s -> 3821.50s]  thing and ask yourself what it's like and ask yourself if you're good at it.
[3822.14s -> 3825.82s]  And if you're not, make yourself finish things.
[3828.22s -> 3829.34s]  And we will be right back.
[3834.14s -> 3838.78s]  Today, I want to tell you about two of my favorite products from Frictitious.
[3838.78s -> 3840.78s]  First up is the EZ Board.
[3840.78s -> 3842.78s]  That's E-Z Board.
[3842.78s -> 3846.30s]  The EZ Board is hands down the most versatile hangboard I've ever seen.
[3846.30s -> 3851.18s]  It's portable, meaning you can take it to the crag, hang it from a tree or from a bolt at the
[3851.18s -> 3852.14s]  sport cliff.
[3852.14s -> 3856.54s]  But what makes the EZ Board unique is that it comes with a mounting plate that allows it to be used
[3856.54s -> 3858.46s]  as a traditional hangboard.
[3858.46s -> 3863.58s]  In just a few seconds, you can mount it above your doorway at home in any of four different
[3863.58s -> 3866.94s]  orientations and use it just like a regular hangboard.
[3866.94s -> 3871.02s]  It's light, it's compact, and it covers all your bases.
[3871.02s -> 3874.46s]  Secondly, I want to talk about the Hangboard Doorway Mount.
[3874.46s -> 3878.70s]  The Hangboard Doorway Mount is perfect for climbers who don't have a great spot for a
[3878.70s -> 3882.22s]  hangboard or who can't drill into their wall at home.
[3882.22s -> 3884.78s]  It's a great way to train in your home or apartment.
[3884.78s -> 3889.26s]  And you can even have Frictitious install one of their hangboards for you so when it
[3889.26s -> 3892.70s]  arrives, you can be up and training in minutes.

[3906.22s -> 3907.34s]  With Frictitious Climbing.
[3909.26s -> 3911.58s]  This episode is also brought to you by Petzl.
[3911.58s -> 3915.98s]  I have been using Petzl equipment for more than a decade, and today I want to talk about
[3915.98s -> 3917.10s]  quickdraws.
[3917.10s -> 3920.62s]  Rock climbing is hard, but clipping shouldn't be.
[3920.62s -> 3924.46s]  Whether you're on-siding, redpointing, or just warming up, the last thing you want
[3924.46s -> 3927.98s]  to be struggling with is clipping your quickdraws.
[3927.98s -> 3932.46s]  That's why in 1991, Petzl introduced the Spirit quickdraw.
[3932.46s -> 3937.74s]  They set out to build the best clipping carabiner on the market, and 30 years later, you can
[3937.74s -> 3942.30s]  still find Spirit Express quickdraws hanging on the hardest roots in the world.
[3942.30s -> 3946.22s]  And these are my personal favorite quickdraws, and they're the ones that I leave hanging
[3946.22s -> 3949.42s]  on my own projects because I love how they feel.
[3949.42s -> 3953.50s]  Petzl makes some of the most clippable and durable carabiners on the market.
[3953.50s -> 3960.38s]  Each Petzl carabiner design is tested to ensure that it can withstand 100,000 open and close
[3961.10s -> 3961.74s]  cycles.
[3961.74s -> 3964.14s]  That is one hell of a lot of clips.
[3964.70s -> 3965.50s]  So here's the deal.
[3965.50s -> 3971.18s]  Whether you're climbing 5'10 or 5'14, you deserve a carabiner that is clippable, durable,
[3971.18s -> 3972.54s]  and affordable.
[3972.54s -> 3977.50s]  Check out Petzl's entire lineup of carabiners and quickdraws at your local retailer or
[3977.50s -> 3979.98s]  online at petzl.com.
[3979.98s -> 3985.02s]  Again, shop for Petzl carabiners and quickdraws at your local climbing shop or online at
[3985.02s -> 3986.06s]  petzl.com.
[3986.70s -> 3989.18s]  Experience the difference with Petzl.
[3991.74s -> 3992.94s]  And now back to the show.
[3995.82s -> 3996.06s]  Wow.
[3996.70s -> 3997.50s]  Thanks, man.
[3997.50s -> 3999.02s]  That's a hell of a nugget right there.
[4000.14s -> 4004.38s]  I've never heard anyone else talk about that, and it immediately resonates.
[4004.38s -> 4008.30s]  It immediately resonates with myself, and I've seen it so much too in other people.
[4009.18s -> 4015.82s]  You know, we just open up all these difficult, ambitious, dreamy things and don't see them
[4015.82s -> 4016.14s]  through.
[4016.14s -> 4017.10s]  And it's interesting.
[4017.10s -> 4020.86s]  You were talking about goal setting, and I just wanted to share a thought that came to
[4020.86s -> 4025.58s]  mind because I've always been a goal setter, but I've realized just in the last couple
[4025.58s -> 4032.94s]  years that it just kind of clicked that it's going to be really helpful and already has
[4032.94s -> 4036.78s]  been really helpful for me to get a lot more granular with my goals, you know, because
[4036.78s -> 4040.86s]  I was the type of person that was like, I want to climb 514c someday.
[4040.86s -> 4043.26s]  I want to climb V13, maybe V14 someday.
[4043.82s -> 4046.62s]  Well, that's all well and good, you know, and I have so far to go.
[4046.62s -> 4048.22s]  It's like, well, just keep punching the clock.
[4048.22s -> 4049.82s]  Get stronger, get stronger, get stronger.
[4049.82s -> 4052.14s]  Like, you'll thank yourself in five years, whatever.
[4052.70s -> 4060.14s]  But I've had all these conversations on the show, and time and time again, I see someone
[4060.22s -> 4067.10s]  else get obsessed and get so inspired by a very specific climb that they want to do
[4068.22s -> 4073.74s]  that, you know, they raise themselves up to the level of that climb so much quicker than
[4073.74s -> 4076.78s]  I'm progressing at just generally trying to get better.
[4076.78s -> 4079.34s]  And that's been a shift for me in the last couple years.
[4079.34s -> 4083.26s]  It's like, no, I want to do this specific 514 in St. George this fall, and I want to
[4083.26s -> 4085.50s]  do this specific V12 in Waco this winter.
[4086.94s -> 4088.30s]  I'm already thinking about those.
[4088.30s -> 4090.30s]  I already know what the limiting factors are.
[4090.30s -> 4091.90s]  I know what I need to train.
[4091.90s -> 4096.22s]  I'm kind of like starting to organize my whole life towards these goals, and I know
[4096.22s -> 4101.74s]  that they're not going to, you know, focusing on these two specific climbs are not going
[4101.74s -> 4106.62s]  to make me the most well-rounded climber that I would ever be, but that doesn't matter.
[4106.62s -> 4111.50s]  Like, it's going to help me forward, and then when I reach these goals, I can pick
[4111.50s -> 4116.70s]  something new that'll focus me, you know, necessitate focusing on slightly different
[4116.70s -> 4117.98s]  weaknesses and things like that.
[4117.98s -> 4120.46s]  And you just kind of build up these different skills over time.
[4121.02s -> 4127.26s]  I mean, you touched upon another really, really important thing, and that's, and when
[4127.26s -> 4130.86s]  I, sorry, when I said finishing game, I was, of course, talking more about project climbing.
[4130.86s -> 4136.22s]  I think the climber who wishes to be an all-around on-site climber, it's a slightly
[4136.22s -> 4139.74s]  different conversation, but I guess I've always been more focused on projects.
[4139.74s -> 4141.90s]  So that's why I said what I said.
[4141.90s -> 4146.38s]  But now what you said leads me into another thing, which I think is critical.
[4146.38s -> 4151.26s]  And you mentioned those two climbs, and you've tried them, and you, so you've actually,
[4151.26s -> 4156.54s]  you've tried them, so you know, like, what you need to do in your training to bring
[4156.54s -> 4158.30s]  yourself up to the standard.
[4159.58s -> 4166.14s]  The problem when, often when we do this is that we listen with a bit of a filter, and
[4166.78s -> 4173.58s]  instead of really, really being neutral and impassive and asking ourselves, what is this
[4173.58s -> 4175.10s]  climb actually asking us to do?
[4175.74s -> 4179.50s]  We much prefer to say, I think this climb is asking me to do this, because that's the
[4179.50s -> 4181.26s]  bit that I actually want to do in my training.
[4181.98s -> 4186.54s]  It's just like going back to lexicon, you know, it's got really, really small crimps
[4186.54s -> 4186.94s]  on it.
[4186.94s -> 4191.66s]  So on, at a first glance, you think, well, I just got to improve my crimp strength and
[4191.66s -> 4195.02s]  my power endurance on gently overhanging walls.
[4195.02s -> 4198.94s]  But, you know, you don't immediately think I've got to work on my step-up and my
[4198.94s -> 4200.30s]  flexibility, you know?
[4200.30s -> 4204.78s]  And so we listen with a little bit of a filter, because we're all like this with training.
[4204.78s -> 4206.14s]  We're notorious for it.
[4206.14s -> 4210.06s]  We all, there's the bits of training that we love to do that we always keep doing, you
[4210.06s -> 4213.66s]  know, and then there are the things that we don't do for whatever reason, because we're
[4213.66s -> 4215.18s]  a human, you know?
[4215.18s -> 4222.46s]  And so I've realized that you have to genuinely do what this climb is asking you to do and
[4222.46s -> 4225.98s]  not what you think it's asking, not what you would like it to ask you to do, if you see
[4225.98s -> 4226.46s]  what I mean.
[4226.70s -> 4227.20s]  Yeah.
[4228.22s -> 4229.90s]  That's if it's really hard for you anyway.
[4230.78s -> 4241.66s]  And each climb, I had to say this, I feel like stuff has come out of each hard project
[4241.66s -> 4244.06s]  that I wasn't expecting, you know?
[4244.06s -> 4248.94s]  And you go, oh, wow, it was about this when, you know, when I originally thought it was
[4248.94s -> 4250.30s]  about that, you know?
[4250.30s -> 4251.98s]  And that's happened to me a bunch of times.
[4252.06s -> 4256.46s]  I think you get better at this, you know, about diagnosing, you know, the requirements
[4256.46s -> 4259.18s]  of the project relative to the skills that you have.
[4261.26s -> 4261.50s]  Yeah.
[4261.50s -> 4264.06s]  And of course, we're mixing from such a diverse palette here, aren't we?
[4264.06s -> 4267.50s]  You know, there's all the physical stuff, there's all the technical stuff, then there's
[4267.50s -> 4270.22s]  all the conditions and tactical type stuff.
[4270.78s -> 4276.46s]  There's so many things that come into it, you know, really with the trad route I did
[4276.46s -> 4283.74s]  before Lexicon final score, actually it boiled down to, if I had to write a list of the 10
[4283.74s -> 4287.66s]  most important things, the thing at the very top of the page was just making sure I was
[4287.66s -> 4289.18s]  there on the right conditions day.
[4290.54s -> 4295.10s]  And, you know, I walked away from that route so many times, so many times when I was match
[4295.10s -> 4296.94s]  fit, everything else was right.
[4296.94s -> 4297.74s]  I was recovered.
[4297.74s -> 4298.62s]  My skin was good.
[4298.62s -> 4299.42s]  I had a B layer.
[4299.42s -> 4300.06s]  I went there.
[4300.06s -> 4301.26s]  The conditions weren't right.
[4301.82s -> 4305.74s]  And I just knew I had to get the right day and then I got the right day and I did it.
[4306.46s -> 4308.22s]  So it was basically came down to that.
[4308.22s -> 4311.66s]  And each time it will usually come down to something a bit different.
[4312.78s -> 4313.90s]  I love that.
[4313.90s -> 4314.62s]  Yeah.
[4314.62s -> 4317.74s]  But the edit, you know, that list is a useful list.
[4317.74s -> 4321.58s]  You know, I'm sure we all do this, but, you know, don't just make the list, prioritize
[4321.58s -> 4321.74s]  it.
[4321.74s -> 4325.66s]  What's the thing, what's the most important thing you need to do for this project?
[4325.66s -> 4328.46s]  Put that at the top and then what comes second, what comes third?
[4328.46s -> 4333.66s]  I mean, you're probably not going to be able to quite work it out in such a linear fashion,
[4333.66s -> 4335.34s]  but you can have a go.
[4335.34s -> 4339.02s]  And I think even the process of trying to prioritize that list is important.
[4341.50s -> 4342.30s]  Yeah, that's great.
[4342.30s -> 4346.62s]  I mean, as much as I talk about performance and training on this podcast, like that's
[4347.74s -> 4353.74s]  yeah, the tactics and strategy and conditions thing is something that is absolutely a skill
[4353.74s -> 4355.98s]  that you can practice every single time you go climbing.
[4355.98s -> 4360.30s]  And I see, you know, cause I travel and go to a lot of different crags and stuff.
[4360.30s -> 4366.38s]  And this usually happens at the, I hope I'm not offending anyone by saying this, but like
[4366.38s -> 4371.58s]  the intermediate crags, you know, when you go to a crag that has a lot of, this is going
[4371.58s -> 4375.42s]  to piss someone off, whatever, 511, 512, 513.
[4375.42s -> 4379.02s]  And there's always someone trying their first 12a or their first 13a, right?
[4379.02s -> 4379.90s]  That's really common.
[4380.54s -> 4384.70s]  And I see this a lot where someone's thinking that they need to get stronger, they need
[4384.70s -> 4389.18s]  to train better, they need to project the thing more, whatever it is.
[4389.18s -> 4392.86s]  But I'm just sitting there like, man, if you showed up when the route was actually
[4392.86s -> 4397.58s]  in the shade instead of in the sun and did a proper warmup and rested longer between
[4397.58s -> 4399.10s]  your tries, you would have done it already.
[4399.10s -> 4402.62s]  You know, it's just, it can be those really simple things sometimes that get missed.
[4403.82s -> 4406.86s]  The tactical and psychological stuff is huge.
[4406.86s -> 4411.26s]  And again, I mean, it is, surely it's not spoken about as much.
[4411.26s -> 4414.78s]  I mean, there's just so much about training at the moment.
[4415.66s -> 4419.66s]  And there's a lot more out there now about technique than there used to be, but I think
[4419.66s -> 4426.54s]  there's still, it's really hard to develop your tactical game without, you know, without
[4426.54s -> 4427.58s]  going climbing all the time.
[4427.58s -> 4435.10s]  And it's like, I've been on, in the last six months, I've been on four athlete meets with
[4435.10s -> 4438.30s]  like top internationals on the, can I mention brands?
[4438.30s -> 4440.38s]  I can mention brands, can't I?
[4440.38s -> 4444.86s]  Yeah, like, so I went with Petzl and La Sportiva and I've been on two international athlete
[4444.86s -> 4450.54s]  meets with the, and they basically, I've got total imposter syndrome because there was
[4450.54s -> 4455.18s]  like 15 or so other athletes and they all climb 9a and above and some of them climb
[4455.18s -> 4458.38s]  9b and you'll know who most of them are.
[4458.38s -> 4462.14s]  I'm not going to start name dropping, but think of the world's best climbers and that's
[4462.14s -> 4462.94s]  who I'm talking about.
[4464.78s -> 4468.86s]  And you talk to these people and increasingly you sort of say, well, what do you do for
[4468.86s -> 4469.10s]  training?
[4469.10s -> 4470.38s]  And they say, well, we just go climbing.
[4470.38s -> 4471.42s]  Yeah, but what else?
[4471.42s -> 4472.54s]  What about actual training?
[4472.54s -> 4478.14s]  Well, no, we just go climbing, you know, and I started, you know, bringing up, sort of
[4478.14s -> 4481.98s]  trying to get into some more, slightly more sort of technical chats about like energy
[4481.98s -> 4486.14s]  systems and this sort of thing, which the Brits are certainly quite obsessed with at
[4486.14s -> 4486.94s]  the moment.
[4486.94s -> 4490.78s]  And there's just not an appetite for it.
[4491.58s -> 4494.78s]  A lot of them are just like, well, I'm not, you know, I just don't take it to that sort
[4494.78s -> 4495.26s]  of level.
[4495.26s -> 4497.74s]  I just go out and try hard projects.
[4498.54s -> 4499.50s]  That's fascinating.
[4499.50s -> 4501.66s]  Actually, even at a 9b level, you see that.
[4502.54s -> 4503.90s]  Yeah, totally.
[4503.90s -> 4507.42s]  I mean, you know, maybe there's some of them are playing a bit, playing it a bit cool,
[4507.42s -> 4511.02s]  but I also think some of them aren't.
[4511.02s -> 4514.94s]  And in fact, I know some of them aren't and, you know, this is all very well because these
[4514.94s -> 4518.78s]  guys, you know, a lot of them are going to be paid to climb full time so they can do
[4518.78s -> 4519.26s]  that.
[4519.26s -> 4522.62s]  And I think the whole training conversation comes back to the average person who has to
[4522.62s -> 4527.34s]  go to work, who lives in a city, who doesn't live near to the crag, but they want to keep
[4527.34s -> 4528.22s]  the dream alive.
[4528.22s -> 4529.58s]  They want to burn the torch.
[4530.46s -> 4538.06s]  And so increasingly now we're coming back to this sort of, this approach of training
[4538.86s -> 4540.78s]  so that you're going to like train and train and train.
[4540.78s -> 4542.38s]  So you're going to find your project easy.
[4543.58s -> 4545.66s]  Unfortunately, it's a false prophecy.
[4547.26s -> 4548.06s]  Yeah, okay.
[4548.06s -> 4550.86s]  It's an advantage to live near to a crag and to do more climbing.
[4551.66s -> 4557.02s]  You are slightly disadvantaged if you live further away from the crag and you will have
[4557.02s -> 4562.94s]  to, you know, bank more on this approach of training well and, you know, and training
[4562.94s -> 4567.34s]  effectively so that you can raise your level, but still don't think that you're going to
[4567.34s -> 4569.34s]  go out and send you a project easily.
[4569.34s -> 4573.82s]  Because I've noticed that this is where so many people who are like lost in this whole
[4573.82s -> 4574.78s]  headspace of training.
[4574.78s -> 4579.50s]  This is where they're going wrong because they think it's a ticket to an easy time.
[4579.50s -> 4586.38s]  It's just not, you know, it's still going to get messy for you out there on the crag.
[4586.38s -> 4588.30s]  You're going to go through doubt.
[4588.30s -> 4590.86s]  You're going to go through, you know, insecurity.
[4590.86s -> 4593.10s]  You're going to go, you're going to feel bored.
[4593.10s -> 4594.86s]  You're going to want to move on to the next thing.
[4594.86s -> 4596.86s]  You're going to get frustrated.
[4596.86s -> 4598.30s]  These things are never going to go away.
[4598.86s -> 4600.06s]  This is part of it.
[4600.06s -> 4602.86s]  You can't will these things away.
[4602.86s -> 4605.10s]  You've still got to want your project to be hard.
[4605.10s -> 4606.54s]  You've got to embrace that.
[4606.54s -> 4608.78s]  You've got to thrive on that.
[4608.78s -> 4610.70s]  Don't think that you can train that away.
[4611.02s -> 4613.26s]  I love that.
[4613.26s -> 4617.26s]  And the funny irony is that, you know, even if it does work for someone and they train,
[4617.26s -> 4620.70s]  train, train, and then they go crush their project, I mean, what are they going to do
[4620.70s -> 4620.94s]  next?
[4620.94s -> 4623.90s]  They're just going to pick a harder project and then they're going to have the experience
[4623.90s -> 4625.90s]  that you're just talking about.
[4625.90s -> 4628.22s]  So, yeah, you might do that.
[4628.22s -> 4628.54s]  Exactly.
[4628.54s -> 4631.74s]  But the project went, yeah, you might go, you might train and go out and find your project
[4631.74s -> 4631.90s]  easy.
[4631.90s -> 4633.98s]  But if you did, it probably wasn't very hard.
[4633.98s -> 4634.14s]  Right.
[4636.14s -> 4637.42s]  So, exactly.
[4637.42s -> 4638.14s]  Right.
[4638.14s -> 4639.10s]  Exactly.
[4639.42s -> 4645.66s]  You can't will away all those things that we have to go through when we're out on the
[4645.66s -> 4647.10s]  crag, climbing our limit.
[4647.74s -> 4649.02s]  Don't will those things away.
[4649.02s -> 4650.70s]  Don't think you can train those things away.
[4651.98s -> 4657.66s]  Just do your best to maximize your time on the crag and understand that when you get
[4657.66s -> 4665.50s]  out there, the training is, once you're actually there, it's largely irrelevant how you train.
[4665.50s -> 4674.06s]  It's about keeping your shit together on the day and being aware of your environment and
[4674.06s -> 4683.90s]  looking at how the conditions change and seeing how you feel on your warmups and choosing
[4683.90s -> 4687.90s]  your warmups carefully and the amount of time that you take in between them.
[4687.90s -> 4694.14s]  And, you know, like when you bolt to bolt your route, like, you know, which sections
[4694.14s -> 4698.94s]  you focus on and which links you decide to do and how long you then rest.
[4698.94s -> 4703.34s]  And, you know, this is the important stuff.
[4703.34s -> 4709.50s]  And what happens, I think, one of the advantages, I suppose, of having been climbing a long
[4709.50s -> 4712.70s]  time is, you know, pattern recognition.
[4712.70s -> 4717.74s]  You know, you can recognize patterns in yourself and you can look back and you can see that
[4718.14s -> 4722.94s]  there were many times when you went out and you weren't actually feeling strong.
[4722.94s -> 4729.34s]  You know, I mean, I can think of key projects that I sent for some weird, not actually for
[4729.34s -> 4730.22s]  a weird reason.
[4730.22s -> 4731.34s]  I'll get to the reason in a minute.
[4731.34s -> 4736.94s]  But I sent the project when my benchmark scores had dipped and I wasn't feeling strong.
[4737.82s -> 4741.34s]  And I went to the crag feeling really down about the whole thing.
[4741.34s -> 4742.94s]  Like, what's the point even being here?
[4742.94s -> 4744.94s]  I was so weak on my board.
[4744.94s -> 4746.62s]  I was so weak on the hanging board.
[4746.62s -> 4747.42s]  This is a joke.
[4748.22s -> 4749.42s]  What am I even doing?
[4749.42s -> 4755.18s]  And then you go down the route in a bit of a sulk, you know, or this was a deep water
[4755.18s -> 4755.74s]  solo, actually.
[4755.74s -> 4757.10s]  So I had to add in from the top.
[4757.10s -> 4760.30s]  I'm thinking about one in my head, but maybe if it's a sport route, you go, you bolt to
[4760.30s -> 4760.94s]  bolt the route.
[4761.74s -> 4768.06s]  But because you're feeling a bit weak, you find a little drop knee or you find a knee
[4768.06s -> 4771.66s]  bar, you swap hands on a hold when you hadn't planned to.
[4771.66s -> 4776.30s]  And suddenly you unlock something and a little bit of magic happens and then you go and do
[4776.30s -> 4777.02s]  the route.
[4777.02s -> 4780.86s]  Whereas if you're feeling like super strong, you probably just go and you just pull on
[4780.86s -> 4783.10s]  the holds like super hard the way you always did.
[4783.90s -> 4786.70s]  You know, so like weakness can be a strength.
[4789.10s -> 4797.02s]  And so also, you know, this sort of, again, like feeds into the conversation about the
[4797.02s -> 4801.02s]  whole, like the kind of inherent
[4801.26s -> 4807.98s]  woollyness, grayness of the mind game, you know, like trying to think that you have to
[4807.98s -> 4814.06s]  get yourself into the right headspace for the send again is another false prophecy.
[4814.06s -> 4819.42s]  And, you know, Dave McLeod famously championed this way of thinking that it's a mistake to
[4819.42s -> 4824.22s]  think that you have to have this like perfect positive mindset on the day, because looking
[4824.22s -> 4829.98s]  back, I can think when I sent routes, when I felt really, really underconfident and I
[4829.98s -> 4835.66s]  sent, or I felt a bit scared and I sent, or I felt extremely nervous and I sent, or
[4835.66s -> 4838.54s]  I felt angry and pissed off and bored and I sent.
[4839.66s -> 4843.82s]  Or I can think of times when I felt like more closer to what you would call this sort of
[4843.82s -> 4845.66s]  so-called ideal headspace.
[4845.66s -> 4846.78s]  Yeah, I was calm.
[4846.78s -> 4847.50s]  I was relaxed.
[4847.50s -> 4848.46s]  I was positive.
[4848.46s -> 4854.54s]  I was this, you know, it almost throws the whole debate out of court because the problem
[4854.54s -> 4856.62s]  isn't the mindset that you're in.
[4856.62s -> 4860.06s]  The problem is convincing yourself that you're in the wrong mindset.
[4860.86s -> 4865.50s]  You have to just almost like detach from it, like have a bit of an outer body experience
[4865.50s -> 4872.94s]  and go like, just climb, just climb, execution, focus, get the foothold, stand on it in the
[4872.94s -> 4878.94s]  right place, get the next handhold, get the thumb catch, chalk up here, now into the,
[4878.94s -> 4884.22s]  you know, and you just execution, game, execution, you know, because otherwise the mind just
[4884.22s -> 4884.86s]  takes you out.
[4886.70s -> 4888.62s]  Yeah, man, I so relate to that.
[4888.62s -> 4894.38s]  I think that is the common denominator because I had a couple of years where I really tried
[4894.38s -> 4900.54s]  to work on positive thinking and embrace a more confident mindset going into projects
[4900.54s -> 4905.74s]  and there was just zero correlation with managing to do that and then succeeding.
[4906.30s -> 4911.58s]  But the common theme there is that whenever I did send, it was like when I would drop
[4911.58s -> 4915.66s]  back to that sort of mind space that you just described where it's like, we'll just see
[4915.66s -> 4919.18s]  what happens, you know, just like try to get to the next bolt and just try to get as
[4919.18s -> 4920.30s]  much back there as you can.
[4920.30s -> 4925.50s]  Just try to get to that next rest, you know, and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's
[4925.50s -> 4927.42s]  really pessimistic.
[4927.42s -> 4934.22s]  And I mean, my two hardest climbs, I couldn't have had a more kind of different mindset,
[4934.22s -> 4935.66s]  but they both.
[4935.66s -> 4936.62s]  There you go.
[4936.62s -> 4937.50s]  Right, exactly.
[4937.50s -> 4938.86s]  Yeah, it's fascinating.
[4938.86s -> 4941.10s]  So how do you make sense of that answer?
[4941.10s -> 4942.62s]  You just don't, you just climb.
[4943.58s -> 4944.38s]  I love that.
[4944.38s -> 4949.90s]  Yeah, like as Dave, as McLeod said, you know, hard routes have been climbed in every conceivable
[4949.90s -> 4950.46s]  mindset.
[4951.66s -> 4955.42s]  So if you get yourself, if you get it right, if you feel like you're in the, not in the
[4955.42s -> 4958.78s]  mindset on the day that you hope to be in, don't worry about it.
[4959.50s -> 4963.50s]  You could still send, but really it's the whole, you know, the biggest one is that one
[4963.50s -> 4965.26s]  when you say when the pressure's off, isn't it?
[4965.26s -> 4969.66s]  You've had your three big red points, you're done now, you're spent, but you need to get
[4969.66s -> 4970.46s]  your quick draws back.
[4970.46s -> 4973.10s]  So you're not going for a red point, you're just going to get a quick draws back and you
[4973.10s -> 4973.58s]  send.
[4973.58s -> 4976.22s]  I mean, how many times has that happened?
[4976.22s -> 4976.70s]  Right.
[4976.70s -> 4978.94s]  I mean, we can tell hundreds of stories like that.
[4980.38s -> 4981.18s]  Well, that's great, man.
[4981.74s -> 4985.42s]  I do want to ask you a couple of training questions because I got some training questions
[4985.42s -> 4987.10s]  from listeners and feel free.
[4987.10s -> 4989.26s]  I mean, we don't have to focus on physical stuff here.
[4989.26s -> 4993.26s]  You can draw on any number of things for these answers.
[4993.26s -> 4995.26s]  But I like this question from Doug.
[4995.26s -> 4999.58s]  Doug asked, since you have been involved in training for climbing for multiple decades
[4999.58s -> 5005.58s]  now, is there anything that stands out as being very popular and effective back when
[5005.58s -> 5009.18s]  you started getting involved in training, but seems overlooked now?
[5009.90s -> 5014.70s]  Or vice versa, is there anything that is very popular and effective these days that seems
[5014.70s -> 5016.30s]  like it was overlooked back then?
[5017.10s -> 5023.18s]  So maybe let's tackle things that were working really well back in the 80s that are just
[5023.18s -> 5024.30s]  getting overlooked these days.
[5024.30s -> 5025.34s]  Does anything come to mind?
[5026.22s -> 5028.54s]  Well, I think the 80s were pretty disastrous.
[5030.54s -> 5035.50s]  I mean, all the top climbers were having elbow surgery and shoulder surgery, and that was
[5035.50s -> 5036.30s]  considered normal.
[5037.10s -> 5039.82s]  So I really don't think we can look to that.
[5039.82s -> 5045.66s]  You know, there was a lot of crimping, there was a lot of locking off, you know, like really
[5045.66s -> 5048.30s]  stuff that was super, super tender and intensive.
[5048.30s -> 5050.30s]  I don't think we can pick much out of the 80s.
[5051.10s -> 5052.22s]  Why do you think that is?
[5052.70s -> 5055.82s]  Just too much of the high intensity, same sort of training?
[5056.94s -> 5058.06s]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[5058.06s -> 5061.66s]  I mean, now gyms, you know, we have a whole variety of different types of grip.
[5061.66s -> 5067.26s]  And so we're using the fingers, you know, and in fact, the whole body in a whole variety
[5067.26s -> 5070.78s]  of different ways, whereas it was these very linear, very repetitive movements.
[5070.78s -> 5074.62s]  You were gripping the same, everything was full crimped, and everything was deep lock.
[5074.62s -> 5079.98s]  And, you know, often traversing on vertical walls, so it's like hips parallel, you're
[5079.98s -> 5081.34s]  not twisting in.
[5081.50s -> 5082.94s]  It's all in one plane.
[5082.94s -> 5084.70s]  And I mean, there was stuff like that.
[5085.50s -> 5087.58s]  God rest his soul, because he's a hero of mine.
[5087.58s -> 5090.54s]  But the backer ladder, I mean, that was a torture.
[5090.54s -> 5095.98s]  That was, you know, like effectively like a wire or rope ladder that was tensioned at
[5095.98s -> 5100.46s]  45 degrees and you'd lock off on one arm and reach for the next rung and then lock off
[5100.46s -> 5100.78s]  on one.
[5100.78s -> 5106.86s]  You know, these things absolutely destroyed the elbows of all the top climbers from that
[5106.86s -> 5107.90s]  particular era.
[5107.98s -> 5114.54s]  And I mean, it was just comedy really, you know, and so much has happened from the perspective
[5114.54s -> 5115.74s]  of injury prevention.
[5115.74s -> 5119.90s]  I mean, I know you were keen to talk about injury prevention.
[5120.46s -> 5124.54s]  Should we save this one and pick it up later and keep it more focused on training or should
[5124.54s -> 5125.82s]  we flick into that here?
[5125.82s -> 5126.62s]  I mean, what do you want?
[5127.66s -> 5128.22s]  Yeah, sure.
[5128.22s -> 5130.62s]  We can go on an injury prevention tangent.
[5130.62s -> 5131.26s]  That sounds great.
[5133.18s -> 5137.66s]  I mean, they're so inherently combined, aren't they?
[5138.22s -> 5140.62s]  People tend to think, oh, injury prevention, that's a real bore.
[5140.62s -> 5145.26s]  I've got to do loads of like repetitive exercises that aren't actually going to make me a better
[5145.26s -> 5145.82s]  climber.
[5145.82s -> 5150.70s]  But if they're stopping you getting injured and enabling you to carry on training, then
[5150.70s -> 5152.46s]  they are going to make you a better climber.
[5152.46s -> 5158.22s]  And the thing is also that some of the modern sort of injury prevention exercises do actually
[5158.22s -> 5161.98s]  have a two-pronged effect and actually make you better at climbing as well.
[5161.98s -> 5163.50s]  This is all the stuff we didn't.
[5163.50s -> 5167.10s]  So maybe I'm answering the second question before I'm answering the first question.
[5167.66s -> 5173.42s]  What we're doing now, which we weren't doing, things like using a forearm extensor trainer.
[5175.10s -> 5178.94s]  I'm not talking here about one of these grip squeezes that's working the flexor tendons.
[5178.94s -> 5182.94s]  I'm talking about something that's opening the fingers out using the extensor muscles.
[5184.46s -> 5185.34s]  What use is that?
[5185.34s -> 5189.42s]  I've seen like iron man, iron man bands, like those thick rubber bands, basically.
[5189.42s -> 5191.10s]  And you're like extending your fingers.
[5191.10s -> 5191.42s]  That's it.
[5192.38s -> 5193.66s]  So, okay.
[5194.22s -> 5199.02s]  A lot of the common climbing injuries, fingers and elbows are caused by this like muscular
[5199.02s -> 5201.98s]  imbalance, like having very strong flexor tendons.
[5201.98s -> 5206.46s]  You know, no surprise because we use them all the time in climbing and having really
[5206.46s -> 5208.86s]  weak extensors because we never use them at all.
[5209.74s -> 5215.74s]  I was put onto one of these forearm extensor trainers, you know, 10, 15 years ago by a
[5215.74s -> 5217.34s]  couple of good friends, pro climbers.
[5218.38s -> 5220.30s]  I'd always had elbow tendonitis.
[5220.30s -> 5222.54s]  I mean, in my early twenties, I had it.
[5222.54s -> 5224.06s]  I got it again in my late twenties.
[5224.06s -> 5226.22s]  I got it again in my early thirties.
[5226.22s -> 5227.74s]  It blighted my climbing.
[5227.74s -> 5232.30s]  It was the biggest, you know, and also when I first got elbow tendonitis, it was in the
[5232.30s -> 5234.14s]  days when we didn't really know about rehab.
[5234.14s -> 5237.82s]  And so I was like resting them a lot, not rehabbing them properly.
[5237.82s -> 5239.18s]  So I spent so much time out.
[5239.90s -> 5244.70s]  Anyway, I got ahold of one of these forearm extensor trainers within two weeks of not
[5244.70s -> 5248.14s]  even being particularly like strict with my protocols.
[5248.14s -> 5249.66s]  I was just like pumping away on this thing.
[5249.66s -> 5252.62s]  But the crucial thing was I wasn't doing endurance sets with it.
[5252.62s -> 5254.14s]  I was doing strength sets.
[5254.14s -> 5259.74s]  So I was doing like anything between sort of eight and 15 reps, like with high resistance,
[5259.74s -> 5261.90s]  building up strength in the extensor tendons.
[5263.34s -> 5268.22s]  My elbows, they'd always felt tweaky and on the brink and they always used to kind of
[5268.22s -> 5270.30s]  like stop me in training sessions.
[5270.30s -> 5273.90s]  I always used to like back off through fear of elbow tendonitis.
[5273.90s -> 5278.94s]  Here I was at the age of 40 and my elbows felt better than they'd ever felt within two
[5278.94s -> 5279.42s]  weeks.
[5280.06s -> 5283.18s]  And they have done ever since.
[5283.18s -> 5285.18s]  And I don't even use these devices all the time.
[5285.18s -> 5290.54s]  I probably should, but I kind of go through phases of being more keen with them and then
[5290.54s -> 5291.90s]  phases of forgetting to use them.
[5291.90s -> 5297.98s]  But the net effect is that I can take a pinch and lock it down to my waist, which is something
[5297.98s -> 5301.10s]  that I would never able to do in my 20s because of elbow pain.
[5301.74s -> 5303.26s]  So there's one thing.
[5303.26s -> 5308.70s]  And the other thing, of course, is that, and I don't have the research evidence to
[5308.70s -> 5313.10s]  back this up, but I can say this anecdotally, because I've recommended these devices to
[5313.10s -> 5316.46s]  hundreds of people over the years and in the last 10 years.
[5316.46s -> 5323.74s]  And so many have said to me that their finger strength, like as in a climbing sense, their
[5323.74s -> 5325.74s]  finger strength has also improved.
[5325.74s -> 5332.70s]  You know, their ability to dead hang or use a half crimp with greater weight seem to coincide
[5332.70s -> 5335.50s]  with them starting to use these extensor trainers.
[5335.50s -> 5336.62s]  And why would that be?
[5337.58s -> 5343.98s]  I can only conclude this because the body won't actually allow grotesque strength imbalances
[5343.98s -> 5344.86s]  to develop.
[5344.86s -> 5348.78s]  So in other words, if you never train your extensors, eventually what happens is your
[5348.78s -> 5350.14s]  flexors just stop.
[5350.14s -> 5352.06s]  They stop improving and stop responding.
[5352.06s -> 5355.82s]  But if you start training your extensors, you're working on the ratio and then your
[5355.82s -> 5357.50s]  flexors start improving.
[5357.50s -> 5361.42s]  So it almost like can have the effect for, especially for old times like me, you've been
[5361.42s -> 5365.98s]  training finger strength, their flexors all their life, you start training your extensors
[5365.98s -> 5368.14s]  and then suddenly your flexors start coming on.
[5368.14s -> 5372.06s]  And this has happened to me and this has happened to so many people who I've coached.
[5372.94s -> 5377.10s]  One, you know, these little rubber gadgets, you're going to spend 30 bucks on them.
[5377.10s -> 5379.90s]  It's like totally game changing.
[5381.98s -> 5384.86s]  Always going to be, someone's going to pop up and go, ah, I used them.
[5384.86s -> 5385.58s]  They were rubbish.
[5387.82s -> 5389.58s]  You know, that's the world of coaching.
[5389.66s -> 5392.06s]  If you don't want to use this thing, that's fine.
[5392.06s -> 5392.94s]  Fill your boots.
[5392.94s -> 5399.10s]  But for me, these things are massive and I can bury you in emails, people getting back
[5399.10s -> 5400.38s]  to me saying the same thing.
[5400.94s -> 5402.14s]  That's a powerful sell.
[5402.14s -> 5406.70s]  I mean, that's enough to get me to commit to using them more regularly and see what
[5406.70s -> 5407.50s]  happens at least.
[5407.50s -> 5409.42s]  And I'll keep people posted.
[5410.38s -> 5415.02s]  Do you have a favorite brand or tool that you like to recommend to people?
[5415.02s -> 5416.06s]  Well, there's a lot of good ones.
[5416.06s -> 5417.82s]  I mean, I use the PowerFingers.
[5417.82s -> 5419.02s]  I'm not sponsored by them.
[5419.02s -> 5420.38s]  I don't work with them at all.
[5420.38s -> 5422.06s]  So I'm not trying to sell you something here.
[5422.06s -> 5424.70s]  I use the PowerFingers, but I mean, other brands exist.
[5425.66s -> 5429.34s]  But I mean, another classic example is like, oh my word.
[5429.34s -> 5436.54s]  I mean, suspension, rings, TRX, call them what you want, like, which just didn't exist
[5436.54s -> 5437.26s]  in my era.
[5437.82s -> 5442.30s]  You know, and in a way I'm like pretty proud that I got up to climbing like sort of 8b
[5442.30s -> 5446.30s]  plus without any of this type of stuff, which makes such a massive difference.
[5446.30s -> 5452.70s]  Because again, you know, rings, suspension straps, if you do like, because we always
[5452.70s -> 5457.02s]  knew that we were supposed to do push-ups, you know, to work on, again, the antagonist,
[5457.02s -> 5461.90s]  the chest, the tricep, but press-ups are just so boring, aren't they?
[5461.90s -> 5463.66s]  Who wants to do them, you know?
[5463.66s -> 5469.90s]  And, you know, as a result of not doing them, again, you've got like these climbers with
[5470.94s -> 5475.34s]  you can develop quite a freakish physique as a result of only just working on the kinetic
[5475.42s -> 5478.94s]  chain that's involved in pulling rather than the kinetic chain that's involved in pushing.
[5479.82s -> 5482.62s]  You start working on a bit of push-up strength.
[5482.62s -> 5484.22s]  It can really balance you out.
[5484.22s -> 5485.74s]  You feel more robust.
[5486.54s -> 5491.18s]  But if you do that stuff on rings, you're also giving your core a massive hit.
[5491.18s -> 5495.98s]  You're just working all the sort of stabilizing muscles, the synergists that fire up and just
[5495.98s -> 5500.70s]  help to keep your body like really taut and like really help you to maintain stable posture.
[5501.42s -> 5507.18s]  You build like really strong shoulders and you just get on steep stuff and you just feel
[5507.18s -> 5509.34s]  more in control of your body.
[5509.34s -> 5513.82s]  So it's having an antagonist effect, but it's also feeding into your climbing directly.
[5513.82s -> 5518.06s]  And yeah, I mean, stuff like this didn't exist.
[5518.06s -> 5519.10s]  I can't imagine.
[5519.82s -> 5523.26s]  I can't believe, almost like, how did we survive without that stuff?
[5523.26s -> 5527.18s]  And, you know, we could go off on a conversation about, yeah, well, maybe weights can do the
[5527.18s -> 5533.42s]  same, but I did a lot of weights when I was young and they did not sort me out at all.
[5533.42s -> 5537.10s]  And, you know, I know it comes down to protocols and there are certain exercises that are better
[5537.10s -> 5541.10s]  than others and so on and so forth, but the net effect for me as a result, and it depends
[5541.10s -> 5545.50s]  on the physique, it depends on the protocol, but I mean, I built a lot of bulky unwanted
[5545.50s -> 5550.22s]  muscle as a result of training weights and just generally felt a lot more kind of clunky.
[5550.22s -> 5556.46s]  Whereas for me, there's something about using rings and TRX, I just feel really sharp and
[5556.46s -> 5559.34s]  explosive and coordinated as a result of using them.
[5560.70s -> 5564.62s]  So that's, you know, that's, they're really, for me, really significant.
[5565.34s -> 5569.98s]  What are some favorite exercises that are staples for you on the rings or TRX?
[5571.10s -> 5577.82s]  So a pushup, which, you know, many will find difficult and you can do these on your knees.
[5577.82s -> 5581.66s]  If you're a first timer, in fact, if you're new to them, I strongly advise that you do
[5581.66s -> 5582.54s]  do them on your knees.
[5583.10s -> 5586.54s]  You can do like I's, Y's and T's.
[5586.54s -> 5590.46s]  So a T is when you bring your arms out to the side to make your body into like a cross.
[5591.50s -> 5593.90s]  The Y is when you bring your arms up at 45 degrees.
[5594.54s -> 5598.70s]  And then the I is when you bring your arms out in front of you, above your head.
[5599.50s -> 5602.70s]  And you do these like starting from a plank position.
[5604.78s -> 5605.02s]  Yeah.
[5605.02s -> 5610.54s]  I mean, I just felt like, I always felt up to the point when I discovered the rings that
[5610.54s -> 5613.98s]  I was just basically like a climber who was just winging it.
[5613.98s -> 5615.58s]  And I was not an athlete.
[5615.58s -> 5616.78s]  I was not robust.
[5616.78s -> 5618.38s]  My physique was not resilient.
[5618.38s -> 5621.18s]  It was just waiting for the next thing to go twang.
[5621.18s -> 5622.54s]  And that's what used to happen.
[5622.54s -> 5626.54s]  You know, it was like, it was just when you're getting up to your level, just when you're
[5626.54s -> 5629.34s]  thinking, all right, let's push on, something would knock you back.
[5629.34s -> 5633.10s]  And it was like a three or four or five year cycle, but it would be something.
[5633.10s -> 5634.14s]  It'd be a finger tendon.
[5634.14s -> 5634.78s]  It'd be a shoulder.
[5634.78s -> 5635.90s]  It'd be an elbow.
[5635.98s -> 5641.74s]  And this was like my climbing between the age of sort of 18 and 35.
[5642.70s -> 5646.70s]  And then, you know, I started using a forearm extensor trainer.
[5646.70s -> 5650.22s]  I started using the rings and I started eating properly.
[5650.22s -> 5651.82s]  And I've never been injured since.
[5651.82s -> 5652.14s]  Wow.
[5652.14s -> 5653.90s]  I haven't been injured since I was 35.
[5654.78s -> 5655.34s]  Wow.
[5655.34s -> 5661.34s]  Apart from like stupid stuff, like helping my mother-in-law dig in the garden, like
[5661.34s -> 5664.54s]  throwing my kids around or something stupid that's got nothing to do with climbing.
[5664.54s -> 5668.86s]  But I've not had a climbing injury since I was 35.
[5668.86s -> 5669.18s]  Wow.
[5670.94s -> 5675.42s]  I want to ask a couple more pointed questions about the extensors and then the rings.
[5675.42s -> 5678.94s]  First off with the extensors, how do you integrate that into your week?
[5678.94s -> 5681.50s]  Are you just doing them when you're sitting at your desk randomly?
[5681.50s -> 5682.54s]  Or is this like...
[5682.54s -> 5683.34s]  That's a difficult thing.
[5683.34s -> 5688.62s]  And it's just, you know, it's having them on hand, because if you find a convenient
[5688.62s -> 5691.02s]  moment to do them, you usually haven't got them with you.
[5691.02s -> 5694.22s]  And I think it's worth, God, I really do sound like I'm selling these products.
[5694.46s -> 5698.70s]  I promise you I don't work for these companies, but it's actually worth getting two or three
[5698.70s -> 5703.82s]  sets of these things so that you can leave one like in your workspace where you are at
[5703.82s -> 5704.14s]  work.
[5704.14s -> 5708.06s]  You can leave like one, I don't know, in a handy place, like where you keep your keys
[5708.06s -> 5708.46s]  at home.
[5708.46s -> 5711.66s]  And then another like on your bedside table so that they're always there.
[5711.66s -> 5713.98s]  Otherwise you just like won't use them.
[5713.98s -> 5718.22s]  Or like in the zipped top pocket of your bag that you take to the gym.
[5718.86s -> 5722.30s]  It's unlikely that you're going to finish the climbing session.
[5723.02s -> 5725.66s]  Like you're going to go down to the wire in a climbing session, and then you're going
[5725.66s -> 5729.02s]  to sit for another 10 minutes at the end doing these forearm extensions.
[5729.02s -> 5729.74s]  You're probably not.
[5729.74s -> 5731.58s]  You're just going to want to go home and eat your dinner.
[5732.94s -> 5737.10s]  So it usually points towards using these things on rest days.
[5737.10s -> 5741.34s]  But to be honest, it doesn't really matter when, as long as you just fit them into your
[5741.34s -> 5742.78s]  routine and do them.
[5742.78s -> 5747.50s]  And let's say as a happy staple average, just try and use them three times a week.
[5748.06s -> 5755.26s]  But sorry to name drop, but like, I mean, I had a really fascinating chat with Adam
[5755.26s -> 5756.78s]  Andrew about training a while ago.
[5756.78s -> 5760.46s]  And he told me the amount of training that he was doing when he started working with
[5760.46s -> 5760.94s]  Patchy.
[5761.50s -> 5766.54s]  And I was like, my goodness, like, you know, that's an insane amount of training.
[5766.54s -> 5771.90s]  Like, you know, I know that obviously someone like Adam is genetically very gifted and he
[5771.90s -> 5775.02s]  can take a lot of training, but nonetheless, I was pretty shocked.
[5775.02s -> 5779.58s]  And he said, yeah, but I'm always working to the two thirds and a third rule, which
[5779.58s -> 5783.18s]  was like two thirds climbing training and a third antagonist training.
[5783.18s -> 5788.54s]  So in other words, the more climbing training he did, more time he spent doing antagonist
[5788.54s -> 5790.46s]  training to balance the books.
[5790.46s -> 5795.66s]  And, you know, he wasn't injured at all, but he was really, really ramping up the antagonist
[5795.66s -> 5795.90s]  work.
[5795.90s -> 5798.94s]  So look, there's a lot of different people listening to this.
[5798.94s -> 5803.26s]  Someone who climbs twice a week doesn't have to do a load of antagonist training, but someone
[5803.26s -> 5807.98s]  who climbs five times a week does, you know, just, just, just go with, maybe go with that
[5807.98s -> 5810.54s]  two thirds and a third type rule or three quarters and a quarter.
[5810.54s -> 5814.54s]  But, you know, if you're just like, if you push your climbing pretty hard, you should
[5814.54s -> 5819.50s]  try and use these things like three times a week, you know, for 15, 20 minutes.
[5819.50s -> 5819.66s]  Yeah.
[5819.66s -> 5823.58s]  It's probably worth reiterating too, that you focus on strength with them rather, because
[5823.58s -> 5827.26s]  it's so common to just grab a light one and like do it for a minute until your forearms
[5827.26s -> 5827.74s]  are burning.
[5828.78s -> 5830.86s]  So the light ones have always existed.
[5830.86s -> 5831.90s]  They're nothing new.
[5831.90s -> 5837.10s]  Climbers had those in the late, in the nineties, but they were so light that you could pump
[5837.10s -> 5839.74s]  out like a hundred reps on this thing and you just get bored.
[5839.74s -> 5842.06s]  It's like, what am I, why am I even doing this?
[5842.06s -> 5843.66s]  No, the key is to work.
[5843.66s -> 5848.38s]  I mean that, to be fair, might, you know, would, would in many cases have quite a good
[5848.38s -> 5850.06s]  rehabilitative effect.
[5850.06s -> 5854.62s]  We could get into another conversation, but I would suggest that overwhelmingly the priority
[5854.62s -> 5856.86s]  with these things is to train strength with them.
[5856.86s -> 5861.82s]  Like imagine you're doing a boulder problem with your forearm extensors, you know, like
[5862.38s -> 5866.70s]  an eight move, like crush fest, you know, just like get them as like build.
[5867.58s -> 5871.26s]  If you're not used to them, if you've never used them before, start off more gently and
[5871.26s -> 5874.70s]  do like easy sets of like 20 reps or so.
[5874.70s -> 5879.66s]  But once you've built a bit of a base, then you want to start doing sets of eight repetitions.
[5879.66s -> 5883.74s]  And usually like this, again, there's different protocols, but usually you like hold them
[5883.74s -> 5888.14s]  out for like three or four seconds and then release them, hold them out for three or four
[5888.14s -> 5889.98s]  seconds and then release them.
[5889.98s -> 5895.58s]  Do like anything between six and 12 reps, three sets of that, and you're good three
[5895.58s -> 5896.30s]  times a week.
[5896.86s -> 5897.66s]  Cool.
[5897.66s -> 5900.06s]  Yeah, that's, I'm very intrigued.
[5900.06s -> 5904.38s]  I'll put some links to Power Fingers and, and some other products in the show notes.
[5904.38s -> 5909.66s]  I really like Iron Mind as a company that's a grip focused company and they have these,
[5909.66s -> 5913.42s]  they basically just look like those thick rubber bands that you see wrapped around like
[5913.42s -> 5916.62s]  asparagus at the grocery store or something, but they're just beefier.
[5917.34s -> 5918.38s]  I like those ones as well.
[5918.38s -> 5922.30s]  And one other thing I was going to say is I've, when I have used these in the past,
[5922.30s -> 5926.22s]  one thing that actually works quite well, I don't know if I should be recommending this,
[5926.22s -> 5931.90s]  but I would keep them in the little cubby next to my driver's seat in my car and actually
[5931.90s -> 5933.90s]  just like pump out reps when I was driving.
[5933.90s -> 5936.14s]  And you know, like your fingers are...
[5936.14s -> 5937.10s]  Be careful everyone.
[5937.10s -> 5938.94s]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[5938.94s -> 5942.54s]  But you know, if something happens, you can grab your steering wheel with these things
[5942.54s -> 5943.02s]  on your hand.
[5943.02s -> 5944.30s]  It's totally doable.
[5945.42s -> 5945.92s]  But yeah.
[5946.88s -> 5948.00s]  That was everybody.
[5948.00s -> 5949.44s]  That was Steve's recommendation.
[5949.44s -> 5950.96s]  Right, right, right, right.
[5950.96s -> 5952.24s]  Don't get into accidents, please.
[5953.28s -> 5957.52s]  But you know, it's, it's, it's, it's like anything now in coaching, it's controversial.
[5957.52s -> 5960.72s]  There'll be people going out there saying that doesn't work and blah, blah, blah, you
[5960.72s -> 5963.20s]  know, everybody's entitled to their opinion.
[5963.20s -> 5963.92s]  Right, right.
[5964.64s -> 5968.96s]  So yeah, then going back to the rings, you mentioned pushups, I's, Y's and T's.
[5968.96s -> 5974.32s]  I'm curious, any other exercises that you like and how do you integrate those into your,
[5975.12s -> 5976.16s]  your climbing training?
[5977.20s -> 5978.40s]  Those are the main ones.
[5978.40s -> 5982.16s]  Now we know how training junkies love to do exercises.
[5982.16s -> 5986.08s]  I mean, you go on TRX's website and they'll show you a hundred exercises that you can
[5986.08s -> 5987.28s]  do on these straps.
[5987.28s -> 5990.32s]  Let's remember that the purpose here is to, is to be a climber.
[5990.32s -> 5992.48s]  You know, you don't need to get carried away.
[5992.48s -> 5996.96s]  And, and one thing that really kind of amused me a little bit was when obviously climbing
[5996.96s -> 6000.64s]  boomed at the start of the century, all the gyms started springing up everywhere.
[6000.64s -> 6005.52s]  And like the whole kind of like strength conditioning, like crew got into climbing
[6005.52s -> 6009.04s]  and suddenly it's like, we're going to tell you a hundred different exercises that you
[6009.04s -> 6009.44s]  can do.
[6009.44s -> 6010.64s]  They're going to make you a better climber.
[6010.64s -> 6012.48s]  It's like, uh, okay.
[6012.48s -> 6014.88s]  There's not really enough hours in the day.
[6014.88s -> 6021.20s]  And I do kind of come back to all these like 90 plus nine B climbers who I've been spending
[6021.20s -> 6022.64s]  quite a bit of time with recently.
[6023.28s -> 6028.16s]  Most of whom just go climbing, you know, and then they do like a minimum amount of antagonist
[6028.16s -> 6029.84s]  stuff to stop themselves getting broken.
[6029.84s -> 6032.24s]  You know, like you don't want to overdo this stuff.
[6032.24s -> 6038.32s]  I am a firm believer that I've worked with obviously so many with coaching, you know,
[6038.32s -> 6043.12s]  you work with, um, there's so many different like personality profiles and I've worked
[6043.12s -> 6046.56s]  with a lot of gym junkies over the years who just want to do loads and loads of weight
[6046.56s -> 6048.16s]  training and supportive stuff.
[6048.16s -> 6050.00s]  And as a result, they're just not climbing enough.
[6050.64s -> 6055.92s]  And also they might even be just generally overexerting themselves, depleting, you know,
[6055.92s -> 6061.60s]  depleting glycogen stores, um, like placing a lot more emphasis on recovery, poaching
[6061.60s -> 6063.28s]  energy from climbing sessions.
[6063.28s -> 6066.32s]  I think you've got a really cherry pick this stuff, you know?
[6066.32s -> 6070.80s]  And so those exercises that I gave you, I wouldn't, of course there's more, but I'd
[6070.80s -> 6074.16s]  say those, um, those are like three or four of my favorites.
[6074.80s -> 6078.24s]  Um, I just, I want to give the wrong message here that, that, you know, that that stuff
[6078.24s -> 6080.96s]  is going to be the kind of the main event.
[6080.96s -> 6081.44s]  It's right.
[6081.44s -> 6082.56s]  It's support.
[6082.56s -> 6082.88s]  Right.
[6082.88s -> 6083.52s]  I also do.
[6083.52s -> 6086.24s]  I also think that it depends on the climber as well.
[6087.12s -> 6092.40s]  You know, if you're operating in this sort of, um, you know, high French sixes, low French
[6092.40s -> 6100.64s]  sevens doing like a, you know, like a fierce routine on the rings is probably like not
[6100.64s -> 6101.92s]  the priority for you.
[6101.92s -> 6105.92s]  Whereas like, if you're more into bouldering or if you're sport climbing in the upper grades,
[6105.92s -> 6108.24s]  then it's going to be more relevant.
[6108.24s -> 6109.84s]  And it depends on the climate.
[6109.84s -> 6110.72s]  It depends on the goal.
[6111.60s -> 6117.20s]  You know, I think just as we all evolve as climbers, as we go on this journey, we just
[6117.20s -> 6122.64s]  have to keep raising the game and tweaking things up.
[6122.64s -> 6125.52s]  And I think that's just what I've done with my own climbing each year.
[6125.52s -> 6127.76s]  I've said to myself, what was it doing last year?
[6127.76s -> 6127.92s]  Okay.
[6127.92s -> 6131.52s]  Well, if I do all that again, I'm going to be exactly the same climate at the end of
[6131.52s -> 6132.32s]  the year.
[6132.32s -> 6133.44s]  So what can I add to it?
[6135.36s -> 6139.68s]  And I think that just asking that question is important, but, but yeah, like that we're
[6139.68s -> 6143.92s]  now at the opposite stage that we were at when I started coaching.
[6143.92s -> 6146.16s]  There's too, there's way too much information now.
[6146.16s -> 6149.52s]  And now most of the people come to me say that they've just had an information overload
[6149.52s -> 6151.20s]  and they can't see clarity.
[6151.20s -> 6152.56s]  So pick what's important.
[6153.12s -> 6153.44s]  Okay.
[6153.44s -> 6153.92s]  I just did.
[6153.92s -> 6155.44s]  It's the forearm extended trainer.
[6155.44s -> 6159.84s]  And it's those three or four exercises that I gave you on TRX.
[6160.40s -> 6165.12s]  Don't go off to like wildly on a tangent, you know, and, and, and just keep it, keep
[6165.12s -> 6166.64s]  it about the climbing.
[6166.64s -> 6168.48s]  But I think you also asked, when would you do that?
[6168.48s -> 6170.32s]  Like, I mean, you typically do that stuff.
[6171.44s -> 6172.96s]  People's schedules are so different.
[6172.96s -> 6179.20s]  Like some people I've noticed that most people like to do a supportive conditioning routine
[6179.20s -> 6183.92s]  on a rest day from climbing by which I mean, a day when they're not using the fingers,
[6183.92s -> 6186.24s]  they're probably not training on the hangboard and they're not climbing.
[6187.36s -> 6193.44s]  And so it generally makes sense to do a routine that involves some antagonist type work using
[6193.44s -> 6198.80s]  the rings, using a forearm extended trainer, doing a stretching routine, and maybe doing,
[6198.80s -> 6201.36s]  if you've got time, maybe doing some light cardio as well.
[6202.24s -> 6206.64s]  You know, just a whole like body health box ticking type thing that you can do on the
[6206.64s -> 6210.56s]  days when you don't climb, whether that's two or three times a week.
[6210.56s -> 6210.80s]  Yeah.
[6211.92s -> 6212.40s]  Awesome.
[6212.40s -> 6213.20s]  Thanks for that.
[6213.20s -> 6213.36s]  Yeah.
[6213.36s -> 6217.60s]  And it's, it's worth the thing that just came to mind for me is like, I've had so many
[6217.60s -> 6222.56s]  conversations on the show with really good climbers and I haven't met anyone yet who
[6222.56s -> 6227.68s]  TRX their way to 514 or 515, you know, like maybe some of them do some of it, but
[6228.24s -> 6230.56s]  they all rock climb a lot, like all the time.
[6230.56s -> 6231.76s]  They all rock climb a lot.
[6231.76s -> 6232.24s]  Yeah.
[6232.24s -> 6237.84s]  But you know, it's like, you can see how sometimes the one particular piece of advice
[6237.84s -> 6242.08s]  will be golden for somebody, but it will be disastrous for somebody else.
[6242.08s -> 6247.84s]  I mean, someone who's just, who's, who struggles to hold their body on an overhang, who has
[6247.84s -> 6250.88s]  a weak frame, who has a weak core and weak shoulders.
[6251.68s -> 6255.92s]  For that person to just carry on trying to address this by climbing alone, it's probably
[6255.92s -> 6261.28s]  not enough, you know, get that person on the, on the rings and on the TRX, it's going to
[6261.28s -> 6263.92s]  have a, it's going to have a potent effect.
[6263.92s -> 6267.60s]  The key for that person though, of course, would be introducing this gradually so that,
[6267.60s -> 6272.24s]  I mean, wouldn't it be ironic to injure yourself doing a so-called antagonist exercise, but
[6272.24s -> 6274.16s]  Hey, trust me, this, this happens a lot too.
[6274.16s -> 6276.48s]  You know, people jump straight in at the deep end with the rings.
[6276.48s -> 6278.32s]  You've got to build that up as well.
[6278.32s -> 6281.84s]  But you know, for some climbers, it's going to make a huge difference.
[6283.28s -> 6287.04s]  I have a one or two more listener questions here I want to ask, and then I want to circle
[6287.04s -> 6291.36s]  back to your own climbing and some of the things that have helped you improve so much
[6291.36s -> 6292.16s]  in your late forties.
[6292.16s -> 6296.16s]  Cause I really think that's super interesting, but yeah, this is a great question.
[6296.16s -> 6301.60s]  This is from Jan and Jan asks, what should climbers who started at a later age, like
[6301.60s -> 6305.12s]  mid thirties focus on to progress in climbing?
[6305.12s -> 6307.92s]  And would that be different from people starting in their twenties?
[6308.64s -> 6315.28s]  So I really don't think it's, it's any different starting when you're an older climber compared
[6315.28s -> 6316.48s]  to when you're a younger climber.
[6316.48s -> 6321.76s]  You just have to start off by focusing on technique, you know, getting good footwork,
[6321.76s -> 6327.44s]  good movement, good route reading, and also supportive tactical skills and developing
[6327.44s -> 6331.04s]  a, you know, positive, calm, positive focused mindset.
[6331.68s -> 6334.16s]  Those are always the initial priorities, whether you're old or young.
[6334.72s -> 6336.24s]  And I think that I do.
[6336.24s -> 6340.64s]  I think the only mistake again, whether you're old or young is to try and jump in there too
[6340.64s -> 6345.60s]  quickly and to try and get strong too fast and to pursue too steep a curve.
[6346.80s -> 6351.12s]  I think it's really important to understand that climbing is a sport that it's not about
[6351.12s -> 6352.88s]  like, Oh, how much do you want it?
[6352.88s -> 6353.92s]  Train as hard as you can.
[6353.92s -> 6355.04s]  No pain, no gain.
[6355.04s -> 6360.00s]  It, this is, it's the finger tendons, especially our initiative, small tendons.
[6360.00s -> 6362.08s]  They're not like the big muscle groups.
[6362.08s -> 6368.00s]  You know, you have to just drip feed the strength training over a period of time.
[6368.56s -> 6374.48s]  As an older climber, you might feel pressure to play catch up because you missed a period
[6374.48s -> 6378.00s]  of your life when you could have trained, get that idea out of your head.
[6378.00s -> 6380.96s]  But again, a young, you know, younger climbers feel, they feel pressures as well.
[6380.96s -> 6384.48s]  They want to keep up with their, their buddies, you know, they're super competitive and they
[6384.48s -> 6388.24s]  want it all too fast and they don't know how to listen to their bodies and pace themselves.
[6388.24s -> 6389.84s]  So there's issues for juniors too.
[6390.40s -> 6394.80s]  But I think the main thing as a source of motivation for older climbers is that, you
[6394.80s -> 6398.88s]  know, as we know, I mean, although I've been climbing all my life, you know, there are
[6398.88s -> 6404.00s]  still, there are still so many people who like me who are climbing hard into their forties,
[6404.00s -> 6405.44s]  fifties, sixties and seventies.
[6405.44s -> 6407.36s]  And some of them started late too.
[6407.36s -> 6409.04s]  So it's absolutely possible.
[6409.04s -> 6414.64s]  And it's not one of these, like what I call raw output sports that are all about, you
[6414.64s -> 6416.80s]  know, how fast you are or how strong you are.
[6416.80s -> 6419.60s]  There is just so much to bring into the mix with climbing.
[6419.60s -> 6422.80s]  So I think it's, it's, it's really, it's all to play for.
[6423.52s -> 6424.16s]  That was great.
[6424.16s -> 6424.40s]  Yeah.
[6424.40s -> 6424.80s]  Thank you.
[6425.52s -> 6426.72s]  And it's, it's funny.
[6426.72s -> 6430.72s]  The thing you said about playing catch up, I mean, I started climbing at age 18 and I
[6430.72s -> 6432.96s]  felt that way, you know, I was just like, damn it.
[6432.96s -> 6434.48s]  I didn't start at age six.
[6434.48s -> 6436.00s]  You know, like my finger strength sucks.
[6436.00s -> 6440.56s]  I've got a, you know, I didn't really discover training and hangboarding until probably my
[6440.56s -> 6441.36s]  mid twenties.
[6441.36s -> 6446.00s]  I was maybe 23, 24, something like that, which, you know, for a lot of people listening to
[6446.00s -> 6448.80s]  this sounds really young, but I felt that way.
[6448.80s -> 6452.72s]  I was like all these 18 year old kids around me that have been climbing since they were
[6452.72s -> 6453.76s]  kids are crushing me.
[6453.76s -> 6458.40s]  And I've got to like, I've got a triple down on the hangboard to just like squeeze the
[6458.40s -> 6461.28s]  sponge as hard as I can and try to eke out these strength gains.
[6461.28s -> 6463.44s]  And it didn't really work.
[6463.44s -> 6465.76s]  Like it didn't expedite my, my strength.
[6466.40s -> 6470.32s]  But I have a question for you because one thing in hindsight that I wish I had done
[6471.28s -> 6478.72s]  was starting to use the hangboard as a supplement earlier on, but with a very, very long view
[6478.72s -> 6483.84s]  of my finger strength, you know, just like starting that process of kind of punching the
[6483.84s -> 6486.40s]  clock and just putting a little bit of time in early on.
[6486.40s -> 6487.84s]  So good.
[6487.84s -> 6489.04s]  So pertinent.
[6489.04s -> 6490.48s]  Such a great question.
[6490.48s -> 6490.72s]  Yeah.
[6490.72s -> 6493.52s]  So I'm like, is it appropriate for a new climber to do that?
[6493.52s -> 6494.48s]  What are your thoughts?
[6495.12s -> 6495.68s]  Yes.
[6495.68s -> 6497.84s]  We're in an age now where we can say this.
[6498.32s -> 6502.24s]  Coaches like me used to get shot down in flames for saying like the beginners should
[6502.24s -> 6503.04s]  use hangboards.
[6503.04s -> 6505.68s]  It was always just like, you will definitely get injured.
[6506.72s -> 6510.08s]  Like says who, like from what stats are we going from there?
[6510.08s -> 6514.00s]  And like what we have to bring in into play is pilot error.
[6514.00s -> 6517.44s]  It's not so much the stage that the climber was at.
[6517.44s -> 6520.32s]  It's what they did on that hangboard, you know?
[6520.32s -> 6527.04s]  And so what we, I mean, for example, all these early injury stats on hangboards came out
[6527.04s -> 6532.24s]  before people even knew about standing in a pulley rig or standing in a stretch band
[6532.24s -> 6534.64s]  or like reducing the load on this hangboard.
[6534.64s -> 6539.76s]  Like, of course, if a beginner goes up to a hangboard and tries to hang the 15 mil edges
[6539.76s -> 6545.52s]  buttless, putting some like really bad strain on the fingers, it's like a crazy thing to
[6545.52s -> 6545.76s]  do.
[6545.76s -> 6550.24s]  But like if you hang on like 30 mil holds with your foot in a pulley rig and you take
[6550.24s -> 6553.68s]  10 kilos off, why is that any different to climbing?
[6553.68s -> 6554.16s]  Answer.
[6554.16s -> 6555.04s]  It's not.
[6555.04s -> 6558.40s]  And in fact, it's much less likely to injure you than climbing, because sometimes when
[6558.40s -> 6560.40s]  we climb, we, we snatch for holds.
[6560.40s -> 6561.84s]  We don't catch them correctly.
[6561.84s -> 6566.32s]  We put a torsional load through our fingers and load them awkwardly, et cetera, et cetera.
[6566.32s -> 6570.24s]  So you just can't construct an argument that hangboarding isn't safe for beginners.
[6570.24s -> 6574.56s]  It's all about how you use it and what you do, but where it fits in.
[6574.56s -> 6578.32s]  And what I'm picking up on here is I'm wondering, Steve, if you have the same thing in your
[6578.32s -> 6582.56s]  climbing that I did, which is as a result of not using hangboards in the early stages,
[6582.56s -> 6585.68s]  you developed a chronic weakness at a certain angle range.
[6586.56s -> 6588.08s]  This is what happened to me.
[6588.08s -> 6592.00s]  I could like, and I've got a guilty secret.
[6592.00s -> 6596.24s]  I got to 80 plus just by full crimping.
[6596.24s -> 6602.08s]  I'm talking like boning with the thumb locked over and I could drag, I could hang like
[6602.08s -> 6607.44s]  this, but if you ask me to half crimp with my fingers at 90 degrees, I couldn't do it
[6607.44s -> 6610.16s]  with two hands on a 25 mil run.
[6610.16s -> 6610.64s]  Wow.
[6610.64s -> 6613.20s]  I just couldn't support myself and I could climb it.
[6613.20s -> 6614.72s]  And I was able to climb 80 plus.
[6614.72s -> 6618.40s]  It was a chronic weakness, but I'm the classic child of the eighties.
[6618.40s -> 6620.24s]  We didn't know what a half crimp was.
[6620.24s -> 6622.16s]  It was either a full crimp or it was a drag.
[6623.04s -> 6629.04s]  And so working in later years with the last sort of 15 years with some of the guys from
[6629.04s -> 6634.00s]  Beastmaker, you know, and they originally like, I did some really cool, like Dan Varian
[6634.00s -> 6635.52s]  did like a sort of diagnostic on me.
[6635.52s -> 6639.20s]  And he was like, Gresham, you can't hide this half crimp weakness anymore.
[6639.28s -> 6640.72s]  You've got to do something about it.
[6641.52s -> 6646.00s]  And, you know, working on my half crimp over the last 15 years was another example of
[6646.00s -> 6650.48s]  like something that I did, which made a massive, of course, it made a massive difference to
[6650.48s -> 6651.12s]  my climbing.
[6651.12s -> 6656.56s]  I mean, you don't need to be a sports scientist to work out why that might be, but you know,
[6658.24s -> 6660.88s]  it was, and I've virtually closed the gap now.
[6660.88s -> 6663.36s]  I'm now virtually as strong half crimped as I am full crimped.
[6663.36s -> 6665.44s]  And it took me nearly 15 years to do that.
[6665.44s -> 6669.68s]  But like, you remember, you know, I came from this era where none of this stuff was
[6669.68s -> 6670.00s]  known.
[6670.00s -> 6673.84s]  You just grip the hold the way you grip the hold and you use the holds that you like
[6673.84s -> 6674.24s]  using.
[6674.24s -> 6677.04s]  And you basically shy away from the holds that you don't like using.
[6677.04s -> 6678.00s]  And that was how you climb.
[6678.00s -> 6684.00s]  But of course, use a hangboard and you, you regularly, you know, in a structured strategic
[6684.00s -> 6687.68s]  and controlled way, you train your fingers through a range of angles.
[6687.68s -> 6691.28s]  You're not going to get a weakness within your gripping range and you're going to be
[6691.28s -> 6692.72s]  a more versatile climber.
[6692.72s -> 6695.12s]  So it makes total sense.
[6697.36s -> 6698.08s]  It's fascinating.
[6698.08s -> 6699.60s]  That's actually Neil.
[6699.60s -> 6701.60s]  It's so similar to my story.
[6701.60s -> 6705.68s]  Actually, I started climbing in a, in a really old school type gym.
[6705.68s -> 6711.04s]  You know, it was, everything was like vertical up to maybe 10 degrees overhanging and just
[6711.04s -> 6716.72s]  these really old greasy resin holds, you know, like they're all beat out, no texture on them,
[6717.36s -> 6722.08s]  lots of full crimps, lots of delicate, you know, slow three points on movements and
[6722.08s -> 6722.72s]  things like that.
[6723.28s -> 6724.40s]  And then I also climbed a lot.
[6725.44s -> 6725.84s]  Yeah.
[6725.84s -> 6726.80s]  So I did that a lot.
[6726.80s -> 6731.04s]  And then I also climbed a lot on granite boulders, which were much more like sloper
[6731.04s -> 6733.68s]  squeezing compression feature climbing.
[6733.68s -> 6740.08s]  So same as you, like I had good open hand sloper strength, relative and then decent
[6740.08s -> 6740.72s]  crimp strength.
[6740.72s -> 6744.72s]  But my gosh, I mean, I remember, I think it was the same season that I climbed my first
[6744.72s -> 6745.20s]  V10.
[6745.92s -> 6748.88s]  I was in Joe's Valley and a friend of mine wanted to try this.
[6749.52s -> 6752.56s]  It was either V4 or V5, but it was like a moonboard problem.
[6752.56s -> 6759.20s]  It was like 45 degrees overhanging with like, you know, 25 mil in-cut holds on it.
[6759.20s -> 6760.48s]  And I couldn't do it.
[6760.48s -> 6765.52s]  I just didn't have that sort of strength on a decent hold, lots of weight on my fingers,
[6765.52s -> 6766.08s]  half crimp.
[6766.08s -> 6767.52s]  I just couldn't do any of that stuff.
[6767.52s -> 6769.84s]  And it's still lagging behind for me.
[6769.84s -> 6774.64s]  I mean, I've been working on it ever since and it's, it's coming along, but man, it's
[6774.64s -> 6776.24s]  a slow grind.
[6776.24s -> 6777.44s]  It's a slow process.
[6778.00s -> 6782.40s]  And I'm curious if you have any recommendations for me actually, because with the half crimp
[6782.40s -> 6788.96s]  in particular, like something that's very odd to me still is that it just seems a lot
[6788.96s -> 6793.04s]  less, like when I train my other grips, they seem to just kind of progress slowly over
[6793.04s -> 6793.44s]  time.
[6794.08s -> 6797.84s]  Whereas the half crimp for whatever reason just always has seemed like it's all over
[6797.84s -> 6799.92s]  the place and it'll kind of improve for a bit.
[6800.64s -> 6801.60s]  Why is that?
[6801.60s -> 6802.24s]  Why is that?
[6802.32s -> 6804.96s]  Oh, look, this is, this is training.
[6804.96s -> 6811.76s]  And, but also this is just, I mean, the more, the more you study it, the less, you know,
[6811.76s -> 6815.84s]  like sometimes I think there's just no rhyme, no reason to any of that.
[6815.84s -> 6816.40s]  It does.
[6816.40s -> 6817.04s]  It does.
[6817.04s -> 6822.48s]  It does improve over, look, it took me 15 years, you know, and I reckon for one of those
[6822.48s -> 6825.68s]  years, it probably for like an entire year, it was probably worse.
[6827.36s -> 6831.12s]  You know, I don't reckon it, I mean, I know it dips and I know it goes up and down, but
[6831.12s -> 6833.60s]  I reckon sometimes it could even dip for an entire year.
[6833.60s -> 6839.52s]  But if you steady away, I'm right at the start, like a lot, you nailed it when you said a
[6839.52s -> 6844.72s]  long-term commitment to this thing, that's the key to it because people are seeing these
[6844.72s -> 6847.20s]  fluctuations and they're going, this is wacko.
[6847.20s -> 6849.84s]  I'm going on Instagram and I'm seeing all these people who are smashing their benchmark
[6849.84s -> 6850.24s]  scores.
[6850.24s -> 6851.76s]  Like, why am I going down?
[6851.76s -> 6852.88s]  I'm doing something wrong.
[6852.88s -> 6853.60s]  Oh, this sucks.
[6853.60s -> 6854.96s]  I'm not interested in it.
[6854.96s -> 6859.52s]  Like, I promise you these people on Instagram, like they're not doing anything different
[6859.52s -> 6861.84s]  to you, but maybe they just stick with it, sticking with it.
[6861.84s -> 6865.12s]  And maybe they're just like making a post on the day when it goes well, because it will
[6865.12s -> 6866.56s]  go badly for them too.
[6866.56s -> 6871.20s]  In fact, it's not a case of badly or well, it's just a case of stick the training in
[6871.20s -> 6874.64s]  the bank, stick the training in the bank, stick the training in the bank and just stick
[6874.64s -> 6876.56s]  it in the bank and you just keep going.
[6876.56s -> 6883.36s]  And like, I mean, we could go on a proper geek fest about whether the half crimp is
[6883.36s -> 6889.44s]  more, it's sounding to me like you feel that there's more variability in the half crimp
[6889.68s -> 6892.08s]  than in other grips and the other grips are more consistent.
[6892.08s -> 6892.88s]  Is that what you're saying?
[6892.88s -> 6893.52s]  Exactly.
[6893.52s -> 6893.76s]  Yeah.
[6893.76s -> 6898.08s]  I mean, that, that could just be a you thing and that could just be because it's your
[6898.08s -> 6898.80s]  weakness.
[6898.80s -> 6906.48s]  I mean, but I do think inherently the half crimp is, it's a weird thing to say because
[6906.48s -> 6911.12s]  it depends out whether you get it or not, but it, it takes so much strength to keep
[6911.12s -> 6915.04s]  it in that position because your fingers are fundamentally trying to be ripped open into
[6915.04s -> 6915.60s]  a drag.
[6915.60s -> 6916.16s]  Yeah.
[6916.24s -> 6918.64s]  You know, drag is a more passive grip.
[6918.64s -> 6922.48s]  You know, the tendons are being loaded passively and you're relying to an extent on the friction
[6922.48s -> 6924.96s]  of the first pad being hooked over the edge.
[6924.96s -> 6925.92s]  Same with the full crimp.
[6925.92s -> 6927.84s]  You know, you're kind of like using leverage.
[6927.84s -> 6932.80s]  You're like hyper extending that first joint, whereas the, the half crimp is just, there's
[6932.80s -> 6937.44s]  so much leverage on that, you know, and I think that's probably why so many people shy
[6937.44s -> 6938.88s]  away from it in the first place.
[6938.88s -> 6944.88s]  You know, I coach a lot of beginners who can drag and crimp, but they go, I just haven't
[6944.88s -> 6946.64s]  got anything there when they try to half crimp.
[6946.64s -> 6947.68s]  So they just don't do it.
[6947.68s -> 6952.40s]  And, and you can just, even with modern holds at modern gyms, you can still see climbers
[6952.40s -> 6953.36s]  falling into this trap.
[6954.24s -> 6957.76s]  So yeah, like back to your original assertion.
[6957.76s -> 6962.48s]  I mean, I've been, I have been coaching beginners on hangboards, but you've got to be so careful
[6962.48s -> 6965.36s]  with the message, you know, because again, they're, they're going on social media and
[6965.36s -> 6969.76s]  they're seeing all this hangboarding stuff and you've got to be so clear what they do.
[6969.76s -> 6971.36s]  You know, what are we doing here?
[6971.36s -> 6977.52s]  It's more about learning initially like gripping technique, you know, the, the finger positioning
[6977.52s -> 6982.56s]  on these edges that just explaining to someone that there are three ways of, well, if you
[6982.56s -> 6986.08s]  want to look at micro percentages, there's like five ways, but essentially there's like
[6986.08s -> 6990.72s]  three main ways you can grip an edge, each which has a sub stage.
[6990.72s -> 6994.56s]  I mean, we could get into bird beaking and all that kind of stuff and open crimps and
[6994.56s -> 6999.12s]  chiseling and la la la la, you know, but, but just like teaching someone like the biomechanics
[6999.12s -> 7003.52s]  of gripping is important and just with lots of weight on their feet after warming up,
[7003.52s -> 7006.24s]  just trying to hold these different finger positions.
[7006.24s -> 7008.80s]  I cannot see an argument against that.
[7008.80s -> 7009.12s]  Yeah.
[7009.12s -> 7013.76s]  We're not saying to this climber, you don't need to bother like climbing or like buying
[7013.76s -> 7014.96s]  yourself a pair of climbing shoes.
[7014.96s -> 7017.68s]  You're just going to like hit this hangboard super hard.
[7017.68s -> 7020.08s]  We're not saying that to this person, obviously.
[7020.08s -> 7020.40s]  Right.
[7020.96s -> 7021.12s]  Yeah.
[7021.12s -> 7025.84s]  That's worth reiterating probably is that, you know, this isn't to be, this isn't training
[7025.84s -> 7027.76s]  time to be taken away from your climbing.
[7027.76s -> 7032.56s]  This is like something very easy you can do in addition to your climbing, uh, to hopefully
[7032.56s -> 7035.84s]  move the needle over years and years with your finger strength.
[7035.84s -> 7040.64s]  Um, but yeah, I, I, the half crimp thing, that's really interesting what you just described,
[7040.64s -> 7047.12s]  because that's kind of my theory is that there's a lot more muscular engagement in the forearm
[7047.12s -> 7048.96s]  with that grip than your other grips.
[7048.96s -> 7053.92s]  And I think because I'm now combining my finger strength training with other climbing that
[7053.92s -> 7058.88s]  I'm doing, I think it's just, it just must be like a muscular fatigue thing that has
[7058.88s -> 7062.96s]  more variation day to day than my ability to just hang on my tendons that have been
[7062.96s -> 7065.04s]  developed over years and years, you know?
[7065.04s -> 7068.16s]  Because like three finger drag, it's like, it just improves.
[7068.16s -> 7069.20s]  It just keeps improving.
[7069.20s -> 7074.80s]  And like, even if I had a hard moonboard day the day before, I can still PR, but half crimp,
[7074.80s -> 7076.56s]  it's, it's just all over the place.
[7076.56s -> 7080.32s]  And there's not as much like rhyme or reason as you would think, you know, it's like I
[7080.32s -> 7082.72s]  moonboard and then half crimp the next day.
[7082.72s -> 7083.84s]  Sometimes I feel great.
[7083.84s -> 7090.16s]  And then sometimes it's terrible and it's just bizarre, but you're, you're inspiring
[7090.16s -> 7092.00s]  me to stick with it for another 10 years.
[7092.00s -> 7094.00s]  We'll see what happens with it.
[7094.00s -> 7098.88s]  But you know, like the way we've got some real dilemma type stuff coming up, you know,
[7098.88s -> 7103.28s]  the way you want to make some real killer gains in your hangboard, you know, I'll, I'll
[7103.28s -> 7106.00s]  tell you a secret, you know, well, this is no secret.
[7106.64s -> 7112.96s]  Stop climbing, you know, because probably those times when you are half crimped it,
[7112.96s -> 7116.32s]  it was because you, you hadn't recovered fully from the moonboard.
[7116.32s -> 7116.64s]  Right.
[7116.64s -> 7119.12s]  So this was the phenomenon of lockdown, right?
[7119.12s -> 7123.04s]  Everybody made killer gains on the hangboard in lockdown because they stopped climbing.
[7123.60s -> 7128.00s]  And as we've spoken, or, you know, as we spoke earlier about the rings, you know,
[7128.00s -> 7131.12s]  like someone's going to start doing the rings and it's going to do amazing things for their
[7131.12s -> 7131.76s]  climbing.
[7131.76s -> 7132.72s]  Someone's going to do the rings.
[7132.72s -> 7133.92s]  It's not really going to do much for them.
[7134.72s -> 7140.00s]  Hangboarding, you know, I must've set over 200 hangboard programs for people during lockdown.
[7141.20s -> 7147.60s]  And I was so like, I learned so much about the way the average intermediate climber responds
[7147.60s -> 7152.40s]  to hangboarding during lockdown or more, more, more to the point after lockdown, because
[7152.40s -> 7154.40s]  I was interested to see what was going to happen.
[7155.28s -> 7160.72s]  And you could see, you knew what was, you, you, you could tell the type of climber who
[7160.72s -> 7165.84s]  was going to benefit from this tangboarding, you know, this climber who had a lot of experience,
[7165.84s -> 7170.00s]  who climbed on rock a lot, you know, who was well traveled and who, you know, you could
[7170.00s -> 7175.04s]  see, you know, like, I mean, usually I, I kind of gather information from people, either
[7175.04s -> 7179.04s]  from a FaceTime call or from a questionnaire, this person saying to me, you know, I've got
[7179.04s -> 7182.88s]  loads and loads and loads of climbing experience, but of course it's lockdown, set me a fingerboard
[7182.88s -> 7183.60s]  program.
[7183.60s -> 7189.44s]  And you do, and the fingers get massively stronger and they come out of lockdown and they climb
[7189.44s -> 7194.64s]  a grade, sometimes two grades, sometimes three grades harder, like insane, like straight
[7194.64s -> 7195.44s]  away.
[7195.44s -> 7195.84s]  Bang.
[7195.84s -> 7197.04s]  And of course they're motivated.
[7197.04s -> 7200.96s]  They've been cooped up and they go out and they've got stronger fingers, but they know
[7200.96s -> 7202.00s]  how to climb.
[7202.00s -> 7206.08s]  So they basically just do what they can do anyway, but they do it on smaller holes.
[7207.36s -> 7207.86s]  Yeah.
[7208.72s -> 7212.64s]  Whereas the other climber, you know, someone who could tell maybe more gym based, he's
[7212.64s -> 7216.48s]  got less experience in someone's, oh, you know, I'm not too good with, you know, like
[7216.48s -> 7221.28s]  my head's sometimes not that good and, you know, stuff, stuff going on with my technique
[7221.28s -> 7222.48s]  that I need to fix.
[7222.48s -> 7227.76s]  You know, you put this person on a hangboard program and they kind of, they probably end
[7227.76s -> 7228.72s]  up climbing worse.
[7229.36s -> 7233.44s]  You know, I mean, in lockdown, hangboarding was the only choice we had, better that than
[7233.44s -> 7237.76s]  nothing, but they came out of lockdown thinking, well, I did that hangboard program and I,
[7237.76s -> 7242.08s]  I'm just, I'm back on the wall and I'm feeling pretty rusty and I'm not really, you know,
[7242.08s -> 7243.04s]  not really feeling it.
[7243.04s -> 7248.16s]  So this is another, you know, hangboarding became a weapon for me because I only really
[7248.16s -> 7252.40s]  got into it in the last, you know, after working with Dan and the Beastmaker crew, you know,
[7252.40s -> 7259.04s]  I got into it about 15 years ago and it was at a point where I would say that I was,
[7259.04s -> 7263.12s]  you know, I had a lot of experience, technique, mindset was good.
[7263.12s -> 7265.20s]  I needed to get strong fingers, you know?
[7265.20s -> 7269.44s]  So, so it became a very, very powerful and effective tool.
[7270.32s -> 7270.80s]  Yeah.
[7270.80s -> 7274.00s]  It's, it's really fun to hear this cause Dan's actually coming up on the show.
[7274.00s -> 7276.16s]  I'm going to interview him pretty, pretty soon here.
[7276.16s -> 7278.08s]  So that'll be really fun to geek out with him.
[7278.80s -> 7283.52s]  Everybody make sure you tune into that, this guy, fascinating.
[7283.52s -> 7287.36s]  And it's like, you think, you know, about finger strength training and then you speak
[7287.36s -> 7290.32s]  to this guy, like I learned a lot from him.
[7290.32s -> 7292.00s]  He, yeah, he's, he's the main man.
[7292.00s -> 7293.04s]  Make sure you tune in.
[7293.04s -> 7295.60s]  And Steve, you might want to allow like two days for that.
[7296.00s -> 7297.36s]  Split it into parts.
[7297.36s -> 7299.12s]  I'm like, I'm salivating right now.
[7299.12s -> 7299.68s]  I can't wait.
[7301.68s -> 7302.72s]  But yeah, I'm curious for you.
[7302.72s -> 7306.72s]  I think that's what, sorry, I just wanted to say, I think it's really wonderful, you
[7306.72s -> 7311.28s]  know, that there's so many influential figures, like going back over the years, you know,
[7311.28s -> 7315.60s]  like people who've like turned on a light for me and who've made me see things in a
[7315.60s -> 7316.32s]  different way.
[7316.32s -> 7320.32s]  And that, you know, like I can talk about, as we have been talking about, you know,
[7320.32s -> 7324.24s]  what are these various things that I've learned over the years, you know, like, you know,
[7324.24s -> 7327.76s]  these various things I've learned over the years made a difference.
[7328.80s -> 7330.32s]  Some of them I've worked out for myself.
[7330.96s -> 7334.72s]  Most of them have come from someone else, someone like Dan, you know, and when I think
[7334.72s -> 7340.96s]  about, you know, all these, cause a lot of climbers either maybe don't know how to
[7340.96s -> 7345.68s]  articulate the stuff that they know, but there's the uber natural climbers can just
[7345.68s -> 7349.04s]  do it straight away and they almost don't need to articulate it.
[7349.04s -> 7350.16s]  They're just good.
[7350.16s -> 7351.60s]  And they almost don't even know why.
[7352.56s -> 7356.64s]  And then there are some climbers who actually have really like, they've really thought
[7356.64s -> 7360.00s]  it through, but perhaps they don't necessarily like want to share it.
[7360.00s -> 7364.96s]  And then there are the ones who, you know, they have the ability to sort of transfer
[7364.96s -> 7366.00s]  that knowledge across.
[7366.00s -> 7370.08s]  And those are the people who've just been so, so important for me over the years.
[7370.80s -> 7371.36s]  Same.
[7371.36s -> 7371.92s]  Yeah.
[7371.92s -> 7373.20s]  I totally relate to that.
[7373.20s -> 7373.44s]  Yeah.
[7374.08s -> 7377.60s]  It sounds like Dan's one of them and those types of people make really great podcast
[7377.60s -> 7377.84s]  guests.
[7377.84s -> 7379.52s]  So I'm excited.
[7380.00s -> 7380.80s]  I'll be playing.
[7381.36s -> 7382.80s]  With your own finger strength journey.
[7382.80s -> 7383.36s]  I'm curious.
[7383.36s -> 7387.04s]  I mean, it sounds like you were the first type of climber that you described.
[7387.04s -> 7390.56s]  Like you had the rock sense, you had the experience, you had this glaring weakness
[7391.12s -> 7394.24s]  and you made huge leaps and bounds from addressing it on the hangboard.
[7394.88s -> 7400.08s]  Was it important to you to make progress, to take time away from climbing as much to
[7400.96s -> 7402.40s]  really focus in on the hangboarding?
[7402.40s -> 7405.60s]  Or did you just kind of sprinkle it in over the longterm?
[7405.92s -> 7409.76s]  What have been some of the things that have really helped you address that weakness with
[7409.76s -> 7411.04s]  the half crimp specifically?
[7412.16s -> 7413.52s]  Well, I mean, I sprinkled it in.
[7413.52s -> 7415.76s]  I mean, long time, it was a matter of sprinkling it in.
[7415.76s -> 7420.40s]  Of course, lockdown was self-certifying, you know, it was all we could do.
[7420.40s -> 7423.60s]  But like over the last 15 years, I guess I made time for it.
[7424.72s -> 7428.40s]  And it's, it is simply a matter of saying, and it's so many people in coaching have said
[7428.40s -> 7428.88s]  this to me.
[7428.88s -> 7432.88s]  It's like, I know I should use the hangboard, but I like climbing too much, you know, like
[7432.88s -> 7434.24s]  I just can't make time for it.
[7434.24s -> 7437.44s]  And it's like, well, okay, when are we going to do this hangboarding then?
[7437.44s -> 7441.44s]  And, you know, one of the classic mistakes is someone tries to do a max hangs routine at
[7441.44s -> 7442.96s]  the end of a hard bouldering session.
[7442.96s -> 7445.28s]  I mean, it's going to be totally unproductive.
[7445.28s -> 7449.92s]  And I dare say that would be really teasing the line for injury as well.
[7449.92s -> 7455.44s]  It's like, you have to do this routine, you know, when you feel fresh and revved up and
[7455.44s -> 7457.04s]  you're firing on all cylinders.
[7457.04s -> 7459.76s]  So sometimes it's just a matter of being smart with it.
[7459.76s -> 7463.20s]  And, you know, you, okay, you want to climb, you don't want to sacrifice climbing time.
[7463.68s -> 7467.28s]  So warm up on the walls, get your bouldering up to peak level.
[7467.28s -> 7471.76s]  But just before you try your hardest project, go on the hangboard and do some max hangs.
[7471.76s -> 7475.44s]  Like don't do it for half an hour, 40 minutes, or you'll be toast.
[7475.44s -> 7479.60s]  But if you do it for 20 minutes, 15 minutes, actually, you'll probably find that you feel
[7479.60s -> 7481.52s]  stronger when you then get on your project.
[7481.52s -> 7485.76s]  So it will help you on the day because you'll feel more recruited, but it will help you
[7485.76s -> 7489.92s]  long-term because you're, you know, you're drip feeding these sessions in.
[7489.92s -> 7495.84s]  And I think what we do know now about hangboarding, again, I dare say anecdotally, although clearly
[7495.84s -> 7502.00s]  it has been studied extensively to people like Eva Lopez, we see that that hangboarding
[7502.00s -> 7504.64s]  works best when it's drip fed in small doses.
[7504.64s -> 7508.40s]  It's not about doing some two hour session on the hangboard once or twice a week.
[7508.40s -> 7511.36s]  It's about doing a small amount three or four times a week.
[7511.36s -> 7515.36s]  So you can just, you can stick it in there at that crucial point in your climbing session.
[7515.36s -> 7517.44s]  Like you've been at the gym, maybe 40 minutes.
[7518.00s -> 7520.24s]  You've done your warmup, you've built up through the grades.
[7520.24s -> 7523.12s]  You're just, and just when you're about to try your project, you do a little bit of
[7523.12s -> 7524.00s]  hangboarding first.
[7524.96s -> 7528.48s]  Initially, that might not work for you, but play with it, you know, and then you might
[7528.48s -> 7530.08s]  find that you adapt to that.
[7531.60s -> 7537.44s]  You know, whether, I think where we have to be very careful is the long and technical
[7537.44s -> 7541.76s]  conversation is whether hangboarding can be classified as a rest day activity, you know,
[7541.76s -> 7546.64s]  because theoretically, you know, if you hangboard on rest days, you never get rest.
[7546.72s -> 7547.84s]  Because it's like rest what?
[7547.84s -> 7549.44s]  We're talking about resting your fingers.
[7549.44s -> 7555.28s]  But I think, you know, if you do a very, very small amount and just effectively just a bit
[7555.28s -> 7562.08s]  of recruitment, you know, even 10 or 15 minutes on the hangboard, you can still potentially
[7562.08s -> 7566.24s]  recover whilst doing, whilst also getting recruited.
[7566.24s -> 7571.76s]  I mean, it sounds like an oxymoron, but you know, we have to look at, we have to look
[7571.76s -> 7572.48s]  at the climber.
[7572.48s -> 7573.68s]  We have to look at the stage.
[7573.68s -> 7576.24s]  We have to look at the volume of training that they're doing.
[7577.12s -> 7582.80s]  And, you know, if you've done like a really, really hard project bouldering session, like
[7582.80s -> 7587.44s]  a long, extensive, hard project bouldering session, I mean, some climbers are going to
[7587.44s -> 7590.48s]  get up the next day and feel like they can do well on the hangboard.
[7590.48s -> 7592.48s]  I'm probably not going to be one of them.
[7592.48s -> 7596.00s]  I'm probably going to do some like more volume-based climbing the next day, or I'm going
[7596.00s -> 7598.64s]  to have a rest day and then do my hangs the day after.
[7598.64s -> 7603.12s]  There's a million different possible combinations, but the overriding, you know, what's the
[7603.12s -> 7607.44s]  take home is that, you know, something has to give here.
[7607.44s -> 7609.52s]  You can't do, you can't do it all.
[7609.52s -> 7611.12s]  And you've got to make space for things.
[7612.48s -> 7613.04s]  That's great.
[7614.32s -> 7615.68s]  I had this question for you as well.
[7615.68s -> 7620.08s]  So when you talked to Dan and discovered that, okay, half crimp is this big glaring weakness
[7620.08s -> 7625.92s]  for me relative to your crimp and open hand, did you continue training other grip positions
[7625.92s -> 7628.80s]  or did you just exclusively focus on half crimp training?
[7629.52s -> 7630.64s]  No, I just ran them down.
[7630.64s -> 7632.08s]  I just stopped them.
[7632.08s -> 7633.20s]  I probably shouldn't have done.
[7633.20s -> 7637.76s]  I probably should have continued other grips, but I just figured that the gap in my case
[7637.76s -> 7640.64s]  was so big that there just wasn't any point.
[7640.64s -> 7644.64s]  And, you know, those other grips took care of themselves when I climbed because of course,
[7644.64s -> 7648.16s]  you know, still at this point, get me on any type of hard boulder problem.
[7648.16s -> 7652.16s]  And I'm not going to, I'm going to go straight to using my full crimp, you know, and, and
[7652.16s -> 7656.40s]  so therefore, and the other thing of course was really important, trying to use the half
[7656.40s -> 7657.84s]  crimp when warming up.
[7657.84s -> 7660.72s]  So I'm using it on V2, I'm using it on V3.
[7660.80s -> 7665.36s]  I'm just about using it on V4 and then it's opening out on V5, you know, but like trying
[7665.36s -> 7667.12s]  to hold it as long as I can.
[7667.12s -> 7668.56s]  So that's the other time when you work on it.
[7668.56s -> 7673.04s]  And then of course, once I get to over V6 that I'm, I'm full crimping again, you know,
[7673.04s -> 7677.20s]  so it's almost like, what's the point in full crimping or open gripping on the, on the hangboard
[7677.20s -> 7680.40s]  because for me, the weakness was so dramatic.
[7680.40s -> 7686.16s]  Now, if, if the weakness isn't as dramatic, if it's more minor, then I think it brings
[7686.16s -> 7689.52s]  into the conversation using those other grips on the hangboard.
[7690.16s -> 7694.00s]  Um, you know, I said there's other grips.
[7694.00s -> 7697.76s]  I mean, sorry, it wasn't a question that you asked me, but I feel compelled to talk
[7697.76s -> 7698.16s]  about it.
[7698.16s -> 7703.36s]  I used to feel quite strongly about not using a full crimp on a hangboard, but I actually
[7703.36s -> 7708.08s]  do think now, again, it's rather like these kind of these rules from the 1990s that we
[7708.08s -> 7712.00s]  used to say, you know, just because there was so many full crimping injuries, we kind
[7712.00s -> 7717.84s]  of concluded that it was a, you know, like a high risk grip, but it was more the way
[7718.80s -> 7723.68s]  full crimp was being trained back then, you know, it was being trained in this very repetitive,
[7723.68s -> 7725.20s]  very sort of toxic way.
[7725.20s -> 7730.56s]  And I think that, you know, the full, we could, sorry, maybe this is one for Dan.
[7730.56s -> 7734.16s]  We could go off on a real geek fest here, but this is one that comes up a lot in training.
[7734.16s -> 7736.72s]  People say, I can't full crimp.
[7736.72s -> 7738.08s]  I hate full crimp.
[7738.08s -> 7738.80s]  It feels weird.
[7738.80s -> 7739.76s]  It feels painful.
[7739.76s -> 7740.80s]  It feels awkward.
[7740.80s -> 7742.16s]  Do I need it?
[7742.16s -> 7746.80s]  And I think that if you're one of those climbers and you half crimp everything, it's still
[7746.80s -> 7751.28s]  worth having a try with the full crimp and, you know, trying at lower load levels to
[7751.28s -> 7754.08s]  see if you can build up, you know, because usually it's just that you've never done
[7754.08s -> 7754.64s]  it before.
[7754.64s -> 7756.88s]  And so you try it at lower load levels.
[7756.88s -> 7760.08s]  You don't push it super hard and see if you can build up to being able to use it because
[7760.08s -> 7766.80s]  you might find that it enables you to develop or to gain superior traction on certain holds,
[7766.80s -> 7771.76s]  certain like, you know, wafer, like micro edges at certain angles just might feel more
[7771.76s -> 7773.36s]  stable with a full crimp.
[7773.36s -> 7776.72s]  So, you know, maybe you're missing out.
[7776.72s -> 7782.24s]  Maybe you're not like finger length comes into it, all sorts of stuff, but yeah, worth
[7782.24s -> 7785.60s]  a try with a full crimp, but just don't hammer it.
[7785.60s -> 7785.84s]  Yeah.
[7785.84s -> 7786.64s]  I think that's great.
[7787.52s -> 7788.72s]  Don't hammer it.
[7788.72s -> 7788.96s]  Yeah.
[7788.96s -> 7789.60s]  Don't hammer it.
[7789.60s -> 7789.92s]  Yeah.
[7789.92s -> 7790.40s]  That's great.
[7791.12s -> 7795.44s]  And I'll mention too, I had another conversation already that's been published with Ned Feely,
[7795.44s -> 7797.44s]  who is like the other half of Beastmaker.
[7797.44s -> 7801.52s]  He and Dan started it together and he and I talked about training the full crimp and he
[7801.60s -> 7806.16s]  goes into quite a lot of detail about that in his book, Beastmaking, for people that
[7806.16s -> 7807.36s]  want to hear his thoughts.
[7807.36s -> 7813.04s]  And he makes a great distinction between the crimp and the full crimp, which I thought
[7813.04s -> 7818.00s]  was interesting, training in a crimped position, but without your thumb wrapped.
[7818.00s -> 7822.40s]  So your thumb's kind of tucked underneath and that's, I've been training that way on
[7822.40s -> 7825.68s]  the fingerboard for years now because of skin.
[7825.68s -> 7829.20s]  Like I would get skin injuries on my, yeah, the index finger.
[7829.20s -> 7831.12s]  You split this part next to your finger.
[7831.68s -> 7832.64s]  Yes, totally.
[7832.64s -> 7836.72s]  And then also the joint, like wrapping my thumb over my index finger, I would get irritation
[7838.40s -> 7839.44s]  in my dip joint there.
[7840.00s -> 7845.20s]  And so, yeah, I just, now I keep the same exact finger position, but tuck my thumb underneath
[7845.20s -> 7847.28s]  and it's so hard.
[7847.28s -> 7848.88s]  It's so brutally hard.
[7849.44s -> 7854.00s]  And at first I had to take tons of weight off to be able to do it, but man, it's made
[7854.00s -> 7856.96s]  a really big difference in my crimping to train that way.
[7857.92s -> 7859.20s]  Oh, I can fully believe it.
[7859.20s -> 7864.00s]  I mean, I just don't tend to do that so much because again, it still represents my strongest
[7864.00s -> 7865.52s]  grip, but I think you're absolutely right.
[7865.52s -> 7868.72s]  If you are going to train it on the hangboard, don't do it with the thumb over the top of
[7868.72s -> 7871.12s]  the nail of your index finger.
[7871.12s -> 7872.00s]  Agreed.
[7872.00s -> 7875.84s]  But something I would do separately, oh man.
[7879.92s -> 7881.60s]  We can do more than one of these, Neil.
[7882.56s -> 7885.76s]  We might need to do another one, but it's thumb crimping.
[7885.76s -> 7887.04s]  Thumb crimping?
[7887.04s -> 7888.64s]  It's not spoken about at all.
[7889.76s -> 7893.76s]  Obviously we know about pinching and pinch blocks and you don't need me to tell you,
[7893.76s -> 7895.92s]  and there's so much information about that.
[7895.92s -> 7900.88s]  But what people speak about or hear about, I hardly see it anywhere, is thumb crimping.
[7900.88s -> 7903.04s]  This is not the same as pinching.
[7903.04s -> 7904.64s]  But I imagine, like try this.
[7904.64s -> 7909.60s]  If your canvas board has a kickboard, because trust me, you are not going to be doing this
[7909.60s -> 7910.48s]  footless.
[7910.48s -> 7914.48s]  Stick your feet on the kickboard on your canvas board and see if you can hook your thumbs
[7914.48s -> 7916.64s]  over the rungs and crimp with them.
[7916.64s -> 7917.44s]  Just your thumbs.
[7918.40s -> 7918.80s]  Yeah.
[7918.80s -> 7923.60s]  Now, there was a particular project of mine at Mellon, the HC Plus that I did.
[7923.60s -> 7927.68s]  In fact, the weird hold on the crux was not a pinch.
[7928.24s -> 7929.20s]  It didn't work.
[7929.20s -> 7932.48s]  Pinching it, you had to actually engage your thumb and crimp with it.
[7932.48s -> 7936.00s]  And I trained specifically for it by doing this with my feet.
[7937.20s -> 7940.80s]  But I know this sounds like I'm talking about one route and it's really esoteric.
[7941.60s -> 7946.40s]  I'm telling you it's a total game changer because the number of times when I'm climbing
[7946.96s -> 7950.64s]  this isn't going to make a difference much for bouldering unless you come across that
[7950.64s -> 7951.76s]  type of hold when you're bouldering.
[7951.76s -> 7957.28s]  But for endurance based climbing on limestone with spiky holds, the number of times I've
[7957.28s -> 7962.08s]  rested by like releasing the strain on my fingers and just hooking my thumbs over these
[7962.08s -> 7963.44s]  holds and crimping with my thumbs.
[7964.00s -> 7965.68s]  It's almost like sticking a sky.
[7965.68s -> 7969.44s]  It's almost like being pumped out of your mind and sticking a sky hook on the hold and
[7969.44s -> 7972.24s]  clipping into it because it's a completely different thing.
[7972.24s -> 7975.68s]  You can be box pumped and hook your thumbs over and crimp with them.
[7977.28s -> 7981.92s]  You know, I speak the truth because everybody knows that the thumb catch, like finding
[7981.92s -> 7985.52s]  the thumb catch on rock is important, but you can develop that.
[7985.52s -> 7991.36s]  And I would say that this is something that I discovered by accident, but I've now used
[7991.36s -> 7992.88s]  a lot subsequently.
[7993.44s -> 7994.72s]  I love how geeky this is.
[7994.72s -> 7995.76s]  This is amazing, dude.
[7995.76s -> 7997.36s]  And it's really funny, actually.
[7998.24s -> 8003.04s]  I relate and I'm just thinking right now, I think that's a big part of why I've always
[8003.04s -> 8005.20s]  climbed better on rock than in the gym.
[8005.92s -> 8007.60s]  I've always done better on rock climbing.
[8007.60s -> 8012.72s]  And it's so often that you can get your thumb on some texture, something, and use your
[8012.72s -> 8013.04s]  thumbs.
[8013.04s -> 8015.20s]  And in the gym, you just can't really do that.
[8015.92s -> 8018.00s]  But I've never trained my thumbs for crimping.
[8018.00s -> 8020.00s]  So I'll give it a shot.
[8020.00s -> 8024.48s]  And you make gains like a rocket because you've never done it before.
[8026.32s -> 8031.12s]  In a way, this is my little sneaky kind of almost like claimed, am I allowed to tell
[8031.12s -> 8031.28s]  this?
[8031.28s -> 8032.32s]  No one's listening, are they?
[8033.04s -> 8041.60s]  Steve McClure went on my Malem route, Sabotage, the 8c+, and he found this top boulder really
[8041.60s -> 8042.16s]  difficult.
[8043.68s -> 8047.28s]  Like bouldering is my biggest weakness and Steve McClure is obviously the king of Malem
[8047.28s -> 8049.04s]  and was the king of UK sport climbing.
[8049.04s -> 8049.92s]  He's climbed 9b.
[8050.80s -> 8052.80s]  And he went on my route and he sent me an email.
[8052.80s -> 8055.76s]  He was like, man, this move is really, really hard.
[8055.76s -> 8057.52s]  And I was like, oh, no, no, I'm sure it can't be.
[8058.24s -> 8063.12s]  I can only put it down to the fact that it's got this thumb crimp on it, which nobody trains.
[8063.12s -> 8067.04s]  And like, even the mighty Steve McClure is getting on this hold and he's thinking I can't
[8067.04s -> 8067.52s]  use that.
[8067.52s -> 8072.56s]  But it's because I spent six months with my feet on a kickboard, hooking my thumbs around
[8072.56s -> 8075.84s]  the campus board that I developed the strength for this hold, you know?
[8075.84s -> 8076.16s]  Wow.
[8079.36s -> 8079.92s]  Amazing.
[8080.80s -> 8082.24s]  This is a great opportunity, actually.
[8082.24s -> 8084.72s]  I'm going to share one more thing that's kind of similar to this.
[8085.52s -> 8090.16s]  This was a funny lightbulb moment for me, but I climbed at Smith Rock for years and
[8090.16s -> 8093.28s]  very often I've got pretty big fingers.
[8093.28s -> 8097.04s]  A lot of the crimps there are three-finger crimps for me, you know, like full crimping
[8097.04s -> 8100.64s]  thumb wrapped over the front, but your pinky doesn't have room to fit on the hold.
[8101.68s -> 8109.92s]  And I remember I was briefly trying a route called Big R, really a beautiful 14a there,
[8110.72s -> 8114.64s]  and having a really hard time with the crux move, which is just a powerful move off this
[8114.64s -> 8115.76s]  three-finger crimp.
[8115.76s -> 8122.08s]  And somehow I found a photo of my friend Ryan Palo, who had done the route, on that
[8122.08s -> 8122.32s]  move.
[8122.32s -> 8124.48s]  I saw a photo of him on that move and I zoomed in.
[8124.48s -> 8125.52s]  I was like, no way.
[8126.16s -> 8132.00s]  And he was full crimping with his pinky wrapped over his ring finger the same way that you
[8132.00s -> 8133.28s]  wrap your thumb over your index.
[8133.28s -> 8135.12s]  And I had never seen that before.
[8135.84s -> 8138.08s]  And I forget about it all the time still.
[8138.08s -> 8143.12s]  I forget that that's an option because it's a strange, it's just strange, but it works.
[8143.12s -> 8144.16s]  It's a really sneaky...
[8144.16s -> 8146.00s]  Did you then go back and do that and send?
[8146.72s -> 8148.88s]  No, no, I didn't.
[8148.88s -> 8152.24s]  But I've subsequently used that grip on other things.
[8152.24s -> 8157.76s]  And yeah, I mean, you get a fourth finger on there and it's awkward, but it's worth
[8157.76s -> 8159.28s]  trying and training a little bit.
[8160.24s -> 8161.04s]  Yeah, yeah.
[8162.32s -> 8167.36s]  I guess like, I mean, it's all these things, you've got to practice them, right?
[8167.44s -> 8171.04s]  You got to watch something in earnest for the first time.
[8171.04s -> 8174.88s]  And I just sort of slightly think about the fact that you're twisting that little finger
[8174.88s -> 8175.36s]  a little bit.
[8176.64s -> 8182.08s]  And I mean, pinky injuries are surprisingly common, but it's all these things.
[8182.08s -> 8185.92s]  I mean, crumbs, you can develop the tendon strength to go climb action direct as long
[8185.92s -> 8190.24s]  as you're progressive and you don't just go like straight in there with footless mono.
[8190.24s -> 8194.88s]  Everything has to be built up progressively and in increments.
[8194.88s -> 8196.24s]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[8196.24s -> 8196.48s]  Yeah.
[8197.44s -> 8198.96s]  Well, Neil, how are you feeling, man?
[8198.96s -> 8202.08s]  We've been talking for two hours and 20 minutes already.
[8202.08s -> 8205.76s]  And I could keep going, but I want to check in with you.
[8205.76s -> 8206.40s]  How are you feeling?
[8207.68s -> 8210.72s]  Well, I mean, I'm working on my endurance, that's for sure.
[8212.56s -> 8216.16s]  I mean, I know we were going to touch upon keto diet, weren't we?
[8216.16s -> 8217.92s]  But I mean, it's another whole podcast.
[8217.92s -> 8219.04s]  Maybe we'll do another one.
[8219.04s -> 8220.08s]  Okay, okay.
[8222.08s -> 8227.04s]  Because I think we did inevitably pick up stuff along the way that we hadn't even
[8227.04s -> 8227.84s]  planned to speak about.
[8227.84s -> 8229.20s]  Totally, yeah.
[8230.16s -> 8234.56s]  And we should probably, maybe we should quit while we're ahead.
[8234.56s -> 8235.28s]  I don't know.
[8235.28s -> 8235.92s]  Yeah, okay.
[8235.92s -> 8236.56s]  That sounds good.
[8236.56s -> 8240.32s]  Let's definitely save the keto diet conversation for another conversation.
[8240.32s -> 8244.40s]  We can do that separately because I agree that could be a whole hour at least.
[8245.68s -> 8251.36s]  Do you think it's worth touching on climbing your hardest after 45 and some of the changes
[8251.36s -> 8252.96s]  that you made that have led to that?
[8252.96s -> 8254.00s]  Or do you want to save that too?
[8254.96s -> 8260.16s]  Well, I think that I covered so many of these details that I added, like the antagonist
[8260.16s -> 8265.20s]  training and the working on the half crimp and from a physical perspective.
[8265.20s -> 8269.52s]  But I think that the biggest things were more mental for me.
[8269.52s -> 8270.80s]  Why am I climbing?
[8270.80s -> 8271.36s]  Shut up.
[8272.08s -> 8281.84s]  I mean, to be fair, I stopped sport climbing in my late twenties because I just got into
[8281.84s -> 8283.20s]  going on expeditions.
[8283.28s -> 8285.36s]  And you obviously spoke with Tim.
[8286.00s -> 8287.60s]  He was my partner in crime.
[8287.60s -> 8289.36s]  We went off around the world.
[8289.36s -> 8292.88s]  I think this was probably a bit before people would think, well, it was way before people
[8292.88s -> 8298.16s]  were thinking about carbon footprint, but we went expeditioning and we went to Mongolia
[8298.16s -> 8304.40s]  and Vietnam and Cuba and all sorts of off the beaten track places.
[8304.40s -> 8306.40s]  And we weren't thinking about climbing hard.
[8306.40s -> 8309.84s]  We were just thinking about having experiences, and we certainly did.
[8310.80s -> 8320.00s]  And then I found myself in my early forties, and then my wife became pregnant with Max,
[8320.00s -> 8320.64s]  my son.
[8320.64s -> 8326.96s]  And it suddenly dawned on me that I didn't have forever.
[8326.96s -> 8330.72s]  I'm not saying, I mean, I'm hoping I'm still going to be climbing when I'm 80, but didn't
[8330.72s -> 8335.68s]  have forever to maybe some of those goals that I'd forgotten about, like the big milestones,
[8335.68s -> 8339.28s]  the Aeon site, the HC Redpoint, this type of thing.
[8339.28s -> 8343.68s]  And as I said earlier, my friend Gaz Parry gave me a bit of a poke about this.
[8344.72s -> 8347.12s]  And he said, come on, Neil, what about your first HC?
[8348.32s -> 8355.52s]  But I think the difference was, I wouldn't say that I definitely wasn't at the stage
[8355.52s -> 8357.36s]  where I felt totally satisfied with my climbing.
[8357.36s -> 8363.04s]  I knew I had more to do, but I think I felt like I'd had so much fun going off and doing
[8363.04s -> 8370.48s]  all that expedition stuff, and that I felt like I could really devote myself to a performance
[8370.48s -> 8371.28s]  period.
[8371.28s -> 8375.04s]  Because a lot of people in coaching come to me and say, this thing I hear this all the
[8375.04s -> 8379.44s]  time, I know I should do a Redpoint, but I don't really feel like I want to.
[8379.44s -> 8383.84s]  And it's like, there is no should, no one's telling you, you don't have to do a Redpoint.
[8383.84s -> 8386.64s]  Some people feel almost guilty if they're not pushing themselves.
[8386.64s -> 8390.88s]  It's like, if you're not wanting to go and climb a project, there's a reason for that.
[8390.88s -> 8391.76s]  Don't.
[8391.76s -> 8396.16s]  Don't go and try a Redpoint if you're not feeling it inside, because you're just going
[8396.16s -> 8397.76s]  to have a horrible experience.
[8397.76s -> 8400.16s]  Put yourself off project climbing even more.
[8400.16s -> 8408.72s]  But because I'd done this tenure, this decade of traveling and having loads of low-pressure
[8408.72s -> 8412.24s]  fun climbing, I felt ready to focus and be disciplined.
[8413.20s -> 8419.76s]  And the other thing was that then, of course, my son was born and I went through the classic,
[8419.84s -> 8421.92s]  the paradigm shift that every parent goes through.
[8421.92s -> 8425.92s]  And suddenly you realize that actually, for the first time, climbing isn't the most important
[8425.92s -> 8426.64s]  thing anymore.
[8427.20s -> 8432.24s]  And that was amazing because it really just flips the whole of psychology.
[8432.24s -> 8437.44s]  It's like, on one hand, you have to push for this goal as if it's the most important thing,
[8437.44s -> 8440.80s]  because if you don't treat this goal seriously, you're not going to achieve it.
[8440.80s -> 8445.68s]  But on the other hand, you need a way of like flipping it and making out that it's like
[8445.68s -> 8448.08s]  tricking yourself into thinking that it's not important.
[8448.08s -> 8451.28s]  And that was the effect that having kids had.
[8452.24s -> 8457.04s]  And the other thing, it's unbelievable, every parent will say the same thing, you can't
[8457.04s -> 8460.88s]  believe how tiring it is and how little time you have.
[8461.52s -> 8465.04s]  And so it just felt like almost like one of those dreams that you have when you're running
[8465.04s -> 8470.56s]  and you've got weights on your legs and you're trying to climb and you're getting sleepless
[8470.56s -> 8473.60s]  nights and you haven't got any time and you're just thinking like, what am I doing?
[8474.24s -> 8479.20s]  But strangely, it had the effect of, and what I loved about this was
[8481.92s -> 8487.76s]  in coaching, the challenge is always to distill the information, to find clarity and to find
[8487.76s -> 8490.72s]  the most important thing that this person is looking for.
[8491.60s -> 8497.20s]  You can't hit them with a big waffly baffle of like, tell them a hundred things and hope
[8497.20s -> 8498.72s]  that that's no good.
[8498.72s -> 8500.72s]  You've got to find the important thing.
[8500.72s -> 8508.24s]  And so what I felt was being a dad, trying to climb 8C in my mid forties, I had to find
[8508.24s -> 8510.00s]  what was important in my training.
[8510.00s -> 8515.84s]  I had to make every second, every hold that I pulled on, every foothold that I stood on
[8515.84s -> 8517.44s]  had to count for something.
[8517.44s -> 8519.04s]  And there was no junk miles.
[8519.04s -> 8522.08s]  There was no grazing on climbing the way that I did before.
[8522.08s -> 8524.24s]  Oh, I'll do a bit of this and I might as well do a bit of that.
[8524.80s -> 8530.24s]  There was like, I do my thing and I go and I go home to my wife and my child.
[8530.88s -> 8537.68s]  And so this brought out this real focus and this real direction and this real sense of
[8537.68s -> 8544.40s]  purpose coupled with the fact that also the pressure was off a bit because I had more
[8544.40s -> 8546.40s]  important things to do than send hard routes.
[8546.40s -> 8554.32s]  And this seemed to bring out a new chapter for me, a new feeling of power and confidence
[8554.32s -> 8556.32s]  in my climbing, which I hadn't experienced before.
[8557.20s -> 8562.08s]  And also, I really do think above all, it is this thing about taking the pressure off
[8562.08s -> 8568.80s]  because you look at the red pointing greats, the guys and girls who can just keep on putting
[8568.80s -> 8571.92s]  their hat in the ring, keep on smiling, keep on enjoying it.
[8571.92s -> 8573.76s]  I always think of people like Chris Sharma.
[8573.76s -> 8575.04s]  That guy just keeps going.
[8575.04s -> 8577.44s]  And it comes back to what I said earlier about finishing line.
[8578.72s -> 8579.52s]  He's out there on the crack.
[8579.52s -> 8580.24s]  He's having a ball.
[8580.24s -> 8581.12s]  He's with his friends.
[8581.12s -> 8582.08s]  He's doing his moves.
[8583.28s -> 8584.64s]  He's intrinsically connected.
[8585.28s -> 8586.64s]  He's not trying to rush it.
[8586.64s -> 8588.80s]  He's not trying to get it over with.
[8590.00s -> 8592.32s]  He's just out there doing it because it makes him feel good.
[8592.32s -> 8598.64s]  And I felt that because my time on the crack felt more precious now.
[8599.68s -> 8602.16s]  And so I'm out on the crack.
[8602.16s -> 8610.40s]  And I just felt that I just dialed into a new level with it all as a result of that.
[8610.40s -> 8613.60s]  And that seemed to translate to harder grades.
[8615.36s -> 8616.40s]  I love it, man.
[8616.40s -> 8618.64s]  And I have to ask a self-serving question here.
[8618.64s -> 8619.92s]  I have this question in front of me.
[8619.92s -> 8624.24s]  And because that's not an uncommon story.
[8624.24s -> 8626.80s]  Like Tim Emmett actually had a really similar story.
[8626.80s -> 8628.64s]  He had kids and that helped focus him.
[8628.64s -> 8633.12s]  And all of a sudden, his training quality and intention went up.
[8633.12s -> 8636.00s]  And he's probably going to climb 9A this year.
[8637.44s -> 8639.28s]  What's the takeaway for someone like me?
[8639.28s -> 8640.88s]  I'm 33 years old.
[8640.88s -> 8642.40s]  I am not married.
[8642.40s -> 8643.28s]  I don't have kids.
[8643.28s -> 8644.64s]  I don't know if I will have kids.
[8645.20s -> 8648.80s]  And I have this lifestyle where it's amazing.
[8648.80s -> 8652.48s]  I have this opportunity to chase weather and spend a lot of time on rock.
[8652.48s -> 8655.36s]  But with that, and I think people that experience...
[8655.36s -> 8658.88s]  The people that have nine to five jobs and go to the climbing gym after work experience
[8658.88s -> 8659.52s]  a similar thing.
[8660.08s -> 8661.52s]  There's always these distractions.
[8661.52s -> 8663.52s]  There's always someone doing something really fun.
[8664.08s -> 8666.96s]  And you can just jump in with your friends and just have a good time.
[8667.68s -> 8671.20s]  There's always things pulling you away from the kind of focus that you're describing.
[8671.84s -> 8676.16s]  So I'm curious, what's the takeaway for someone like me who still wants to improve
[8676.16s -> 8677.12s]  significantly?
[8677.12s -> 8679.12s]  And I don't want to wait till I'm 45.
[8680.16s -> 8682.08s]  Yeah, this is really important.
[8682.08s -> 8688.56s]  So the thing is that you must never see the kind of social fun type climbing sessions
[8688.56s -> 8692.72s]  as detracting from the serious structured training.
[8692.72s -> 8694.24s]  Don't see them as something that are...
[8695.28s -> 8697.44s]  They're not taking you further away from the goal.
[8697.44s -> 8698.96s]  They're actually taking you closer to it.
[8699.52s -> 8703.44s]  I have a golden rule in coaching and setting training programs.
[8703.44s -> 8709.44s]  I set someone a training program of anything between, let's say, eight and 16 weeks in
[8709.44s -> 8710.00s]  length.
[8710.00s -> 8713.84s]  They follow this training program and then they feedback to me at the end.
[8713.84s -> 8714.80s]  Yeah, I followed the plan.
[8714.80s -> 8716.00s]  I'm feeling super strong.
[8716.00s -> 8717.12s]  Right, I want to do another one.
[8718.16s -> 8719.84s]  And I say, well, no, I'm afraid you can't do that.
[8719.84s -> 8720.64s]  And they're like, what?
[8720.64s -> 8720.88s]  What?
[8720.88s -> 8722.32s]  But I want to do another training plan.
[8722.32s -> 8722.96s]  I'm like, no, no.
[8722.96s -> 8724.00s]  What was the training for?
[8724.00s -> 8727.36s]  You need to go out and you just need to freestyle for a bit, go climbing.
[8727.76s -> 8733.20s]  You know, if you haven't got things that you want to send, just go climb nice stuff.
[8733.20s -> 8737.28s]  Hang out with your buddies, you know, and like you have to...
[8738.08s -> 8739.84s]  And usually in any training plan...
[8739.84s -> 8742.80s]  So people have begged me for another training plan.
[8742.80s -> 8743.76s]  I refuse to do it.
[8743.76s -> 8748.08s]  I'll say a minimum of two months, you know, where they have to just go climbing.
[8748.08s -> 8753.84s]  And equally within that training program, nine times out of 10 each week, I will set
[8753.84s -> 8756.96s]  this person what I call a freestyle session where they can just do what they want.
[8757.92s -> 8762.32s]  Because I think the structure can start to become a prison.
[8763.36s -> 8767.44s]  And the training sort of from a physical perspective, it can.
[8767.44s -> 8771.68s]  I think you can lose your adaptability as a climber and your kind of nose.
[8771.68s -> 8775.52s]  You can lose your kind of instinct if you're always within this kind of structure.
[8775.52s -> 8777.20s]  Maybe this isn't quite what you were talking about.
[8778.00s -> 8778.64s]  This is great.
[8778.64s -> 8780.24s]  This is super relevant for me.
[8780.24s -> 8780.88s]  Yeah.
[8780.88s -> 8787.12s]  Like you can become too like structured and performance-orientated and spreadsheet-focused
[8788.00s -> 8791.44s]  You know, you think of like, you just have to bring it back to those guys, you know,
[8791.44s -> 8794.72s]  the top guys who are just a lot of them are just climbing.
[8794.72s -> 8798.72s]  And so I think that freestyle stuff is...
[8800.24s -> 8805.04s]  You have to have it there at a micro level within a week.
[8805.04s -> 8811.28s]  Or even if you have a structured session, can you put like a 30-minute block in that
[8811.28s -> 8812.64s]  session where you can do what you want?
[8813.44s -> 8818.00s]  You might do two hours of structured stuff and 30 minutes freestyle.
[8818.88s -> 8821.12s]  And equally, so that's on a micro level.
[8821.12s -> 8826.56s]  And then like meso level, within a structured plan, you might have a week where you just
[8826.56s -> 8827.12s]  freestyle.
[8828.00s -> 8834.24s]  Or a macro level, you might follow a structured 16-week plan and then have two months when
[8834.24s -> 8835.76s]  you're unstructured.
[8835.76s -> 8841.28s]  Don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that unstructured stuff isn't beneficial.
[8841.92s -> 8843.36s]  It all fits together.
[8843.36s -> 8849.04s]  And you have to have that there as part of being a climber, but just also fundamentally
[8849.04s -> 8849.76s]  being a human.
[8849.76s -> 8854.88s]  You know, we do need that freedom and the opportunity to express ourselves and be creative
[8854.88s -> 8855.60s]  as climbers.
[8856.48s -> 8857.12s]  I love it.
[8857.12s -> 8858.56s]  That's so valuable.
[8858.56s -> 8865.28s]  And yeah, I mean, it really resonates with me because I'm the type of person that, you
[8865.28s -> 8869.68s]  know, I get excited about something and then I kind of get caught up in the trap of like,
[8870.32s -> 8871.12s]  this is great.
[8871.12s -> 8871.92s]  This is exciting.
[8871.92s -> 8872.88s]  This is working.
[8872.88s -> 8874.32s]  More of it is better, you know?
[8874.32s -> 8875.28s]  More is better.
[8875.28s -> 8876.00s]  More is better.
[8876.00s -> 8879.44s]  But like anything, I mean, training has helped me in climbing.
[8880.08s -> 8883.12s]  Spending more time, like hitting the road and spending more time on rock has helped
[8883.12s -> 8884.00s]  me in climbing.
[8884.00s -> 8888.48s]  And it's really about, like everything in life, it's about balance and it's about paying
[8888.48s -> 8894.24s]  attention to what you're inspired by and listen to your body, listen to your mind and your
[8894.24s -> 8894.88s]  motivation.
[8895.84s -> 8900.96s]  And that's tough because I often want it to just be formulaic, you know?
[8900.96s -> 8902.56s]  Like I want to know what to expect.
[8902.56s -> 8903.84s]  I want to have a plan.
[8904.72s -> 8909.44s]  And I don't like the idea that I have to be fluid and flexible, but that's part of being
[8909.44s -> 8910.16s]  a human.
[8910.16s -> 8912.00s]  And I've benefited a lot.
[8913.44s -> 8915.04s]  Yeah, I've benefited a lot from that.
[8915.04s -> 8919.84s]  Like for years, I treated myself like a robot for years, like without stop.
[8919.84s -> 8924.88s]  And it's been really helpful for me in the last couple of years to kind of tune back
[8924.88s -> 8930.56s]  into like the more vibey, you know, the more feeling-based parts of myself in my climbing
[8930.56s -> 8931.04s]  and training.
[8931.04s -> 8933.04s]  And yeah, it's been really helpful.
[8933.04s -> 8933.84s]  And it's still challenging.
[8933.84s -> 8935.28s]  I still struggle with that all the time.
[8935.28s -> 8935.78s]  Yeah.
[8936.40s -> 8938.88s]  Liberating as well, you know, it's fun.
[8938.88s -> 8940.24s]  It's fun to do that.
[8940.24s -> 8941.52s]  It's so important.
[8941.52s -> 8945.68s]  And, you know, look around at the top climbers and they're all doing that too.
[8946.56s -> 8952.00s]  But also I think, you know, we almost didn't need to have the diet nutrition conversation
[8952.00s -> 8958.72s]  because what you said so pertinently summarized the approach to nutrition, like even more
[8958.72s -> 8961.12s]  that when you said more is better.
[8961.12s -> 8967.36s]  And I think when people try a diet that starts to work for them, you know, as did I with
[8967.36s -> 8973.20s]  low carbon keto, you know, you then go in a little bit deeper and it works even better.
[8973.76s -> 8975.12s]  And then there's a tipping point.
[8975.68s -> 8978.72s]  When it stops working because you overcook it.
[8979.36s -> 8983.68s]  And I've seen so much, like it surprises me.
[8983.68s -> 8987.04s]  I feel like this is so simple and so obvious, but it really isn't.
[8988.48s -> 8992.88s]  This climber will say never diet or never follow, you know, it's just so bad for you.
[8992.88s -> 8994.64s]  And it's like, well, yeah, but look what you did.
[8994.64s -> 8996.56s]  It's like, it's not surprising that was bad for you.
[8996.56s -> 8999.76s]  You just pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it until you hit the red line.
[9000.40s -> 9001.36s]  It's like training.
[9001.36s -> 9002.32s]  You can overdo it.
[9002.32s -> 9003.92s]  You have to cycle it.
[9003.92s -> 9008.80s]  You know, and also you have to manipulate it according to the stage you're at in your
[9008.80s -> 9009.60s]  training campaign.
[9009.60s -> 9013.28s]  If you're in a load phase, if you're working on strength, if you're working on insurance,
[9013.28s -> 9016.64s]  if you're peaking, when you're getting close, it's doing your project, you're changing this.
[9016.64s -> 9021.36s]  And then when you do your project and you just come off the gas, you know, like you've
[9021.36s -> 9022.48s]  got to cycle this.
[9025.04s -> 9031.44s]  So, you know, I just, I think it's even more likely that from what I can see, people are
[9031.44s -> 9035.20s]  falling into this trap even more with diet, with nutrition than they are with training,
[9035.20s -> 9036.56s]  which is thinking more is better.
[9037.20s -> 9038.08s]  I think you're right.
[9038.08s -> 9038.56s]  Yeah.
[9038.56s -> 9040.48s]  I mean, I'm raising my hand.
[9040.48s -> 9042.48s]  I'm, I was that person for sure.
[9043.52s -> 9048.40s]  And it's, it's come, yeah, it's, it's, it's taken a long time to even feel like I might
[9048.40s -> 9053.76s]  be able to trust myself to, to try anything like that again, to even try a structured
[9053.76s -> 9057.84s]  way of eating in any way, you know, cause, cause I'm, I know my own tendencies.
[9059.84s -> 9060.48s]  But yeah, yeah.
[9060.48s -> 9061.20s]  Thanks for all that.
[9061.52s -> 9068.00s]  You said some things in our first phone call that, about the keto diet and the impact that
[9068.00s -> 9071.52s]  it's had on you and the, I mean, the incredible impact that it's had on your climbing.
[9071.52s -> 9075.60s]  So I think we should, I would love to have that conversation if you're up for it, but
[9076.80s -> 9079.84s]  let's leave that as a teaser for next time and we can do another one of these.
[9080.88s -> 9082.00s]  This has been amazing, man.
[9082.00s -> 9086.72s]  You've given me two and a half hours of just, just gold.
[9086.72s -> 9091.36s]  I mean, you just, you, you just are so experienced and you're, you're so well-spoken and this
[9091.36s -> 9095.76s]  is just, we went all sorts of directions that I didn't even have in my notes that I'm so
[9095.76s -> 9096.48s]  glad we did.
[9096.48s -> 9100.72s]  Cause you've just shared so much for me and for everyone listening.
[9100.72s -> 9101.36s]  So thank you.
[9101.92s -> 9104.16s]  And I just want to give you a chance in return.
[9104.16s -> 9105.84s]  Like, do you have anything you want to plug?
[9105.84s -> 9110.00s]  Can people hire you as a coach right now or any, anything that you're doing that you're
[9110.00s -> 9111.44s]  excited about sharing with people?
[9113.12s -> 9114.00s]  Not really.
[9114.00s -> 9119.36s]  I mean, you know, I'm on my Instagram, you can follow me there and got a website and
[9119.36s -> 9124.32s]  you know, I just, I don't really, it feels like it's been such a great conversation.
[9124.32s -> 9127.76s]  I don't want to spoil it by some sort of commercial plug for me at the end.
[9127.76s -> 9129.12s]  I'm kind of cool now.
[9129.12s -> 9130.24s]  I mean, honestly, thanks.
[9130.24s -> 9136.40s]  I've worked for La Sportiva and Petzl and Osprey, you know, they use their kit.
[9136.40s -> 9141.92s]  I think that's that really, that's kind of you to offer me the opportunity, but just
[9141.92s -> 9146.40s]  to flick that back and say, you know, these things don't happen unless the right questions
[9146.40s -> 9151.20s]  are asked and, and, you know, you, with your level of, you know, insight and intellect
[9151.20s -> 9155.76s]  on climbing, it really did feel like, you know, you forced me to dig deep.
[9155.76s -> 9157.28s]  So thanks, thanks to you, Steve.
[9157.84s -> 9159.20s]  Oh, well, I appreciate that.
[9159.20s -> 9159.68s]  Yeah.
[9159.68s -> 9164.64s]  It's, it's so much fun to meet you and to have conversations like this and can't wait
[9164.64s -> 9165.20s]  to do it again.
[9166.56s -> 9167.76s]  Let's do round two soon.
[9168.56s -> 9169.36s]  All right, man.
[9169.36s -> 9169.68s]  Cheers.
[9169.68s -> 9170.24s]  Thank you.
[9170.24s -> 9170.88s]  Okay.
[9170.88s -> 9175.84s]  Take care.

[9196.00s -> 9199.76s]  I really want to have that conversation with Neil, but I only want to do that if it's something
