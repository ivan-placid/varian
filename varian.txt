[0.00s -> 6.96s]  This episode is brought to you by Rhino Skin Solutions, my go-to when it comes to taking
[6.96s -> 9.08s]  care of my skin.
[9.08s -> 14.68s]  I've been using the performance cream to keep my skin dry here in Tensleep, where I'm climbing
[14.68s -> 15.68s]  right now.
[15.68s -> 21.08s]  It's oscillating between being kind of warm and being cold and rainy, and the dry cream
[21.08s -> 24.56s]  really helps me keep my skin dry on those humid days.
[24.56s -> 28.40s]  I've been using the repair cream in the evenings to help my skin heal faster between sport
[28.40s -> 33.28s]  climbing sessions, and this is exactly why Rhino Skin Solutions is so amazing.

[83.76s -> 88.92s]  When Jordan Cannon, a young climber infatuated with climbing history, meets climbing legend
[88.92s -> 94.16s]  Mark Hudon, a Yosemite Big Wall free-climbing pioneer, they form an unlikely partnership
[94.16s -> 96.40s]  around a common goal.
[96.40s -> 100.52s]  Jordan wants to free-climb the Free Rider on El Cap in a day, and Mark hopes to free
[100.52s -> 105.16s]  the route in as many days as it takes and accomplish his lifelong goal of free-climbing
[105.16s -> 106.48s]  El Capitan.
[106.48s -> 111.56s]  Follow their story in Free As Can Be, a short climbing film brought to you by Arcteryx.
[111.56s -> 113.28s]  I watched the film about a month ago.
[113.28s -> 114.76s]  It's 31 minutes long.
[114.76s -> 116.38s]  It's so well done.
[116.38s -> 121.72s]  It's a story of climbing partnership and adventure, and if you love this podcast, and especially
[121.72s -> 127.68s]  if you loved my episode with Jordan Cannon, episode 115, one of my favorites, then I know
[127.68s -> 130.20s]  you'll love the film.

[156.60s -> 159.48s]  And finally, this episode is brought to you by Grasshopper Climbing.
[159.48s -> 162.72s]  I have tried all of the training boards on the market.
[162.72s -> 165.80s]  I love them all, but the Grasshopper board is my favorite.
[165.80s -> 170.44s]  I cannot wait to buy a house or a property someday just so I can own one of these so
[170.44s -> 172.40s]  I can train on it every day.
[172.40s -> 173.40s]  Why is it my favorite?
[173.40s -> 175.66s]  Well, first off, they got the basics right.
[175.66s -> 179.72s]  You can actually warm up on the board, which is super critical if you're thinking about
[179.72s -> 183.12s]  putting a board in your garage, and that's all you have to train on.
[183.12s -> 187.08s]  The LED lights are in the right spot and are easy to see when you're climbing, and the
[187.08s -> 189.92s]  wall angle is easy to adjust.
[189.92s -> 193.08s]  Those three things already set the Grasshopper board apart.
[193.36s -> 195.84s]  More than that, I absolutely love their hold set.
[195.84s -> 199.46s]  As soon as I climbed on the board, I could tell the folks at Grasshopper put a ton of
[199.46s -> 203.24s]  thought into the hold shapes and the layout.
[203.24s -> 205.92s]  The layout is also mirrored, which I love.
[205.92s -> 209.56s]  It's really cool to try a boulder problem and then flip it around in the app and see
[209.56s -> 211.72s]  if it feels different climbing it the other way around.
[211.72s -> 215.72s]  I think that's a great diagnostic tool, and I love that if I find a cool boulder problem
[215.72s -> 219.64s]  in the app, I immediately have two to work on that are equally good because I can just
[219.64s -> 222.68s]  flip it around and climb the mirrored boulder problem.
[222.68s -> 227.48s]  Anyway, that's why I love the Grasshopper board, but as always, don't take my word
[227.48s -> 228.48s]  for it.
[228.48s -> 231.24s]  The folks at Grasshopper just want you to try it out for yourself.
[231.24s -> 236.36s]  Be sure to check them out on Instagram at grasshopperclimbing if you want to see the board in action, and
[236.36s -> 242.24s]  you can visit their brand new website at grasshopperclimbing.com to learn more and contact their sales team
[242.24s -> 245.88s]  to find out where you can go try a board and to find out which board solution might be
[245.88s -> 246.88s]  right for you.
[247.16s -> 250.48s]  And if you're ready to pull the trigger on a Grasshopper board, the folks at Grasshopper
[250.48s -> 258.16s]  are offering you guys, listeners to this podcast, $500 off when you order a fully kitted out
[258.16s -> 259.80s]  8x10 foot board.
[259.80s -> 263.76s]  That's their smallest board, and you can save even more money if you upgrade to a larger
[263.76s -> 264.76s]  board.
[264.76s -> 267.30s]  Just tell them I sent you or that you learned about the Grasshopper board from the Nugget
[267.30s -> 270.76s]  podcast and they'll hook it up and save you hundreds of dollars.
[270.76s -> 275.20s]  That's like three pairs of climbing shoes you can save just for listening to this podcast.

[279.72s -> 287.24s]  grasshopperclimbing.com and be sure to tell them I sent you.
[287.24s -> 288.24s]  Hello friends.
[288.24s -> 291.76s]  Welcome to another episode of the Nugget Climbing Podcast.
[291.76s -> 295.20s]  This is your host, Stephen Dimmitt, as always.
[295.20s -> 297.56s]  And my guest today is Dan Varian.
[297.56s -> 301.96s]  If you recognize that name, that's because Dan has been mentioned on the podcast a couple
[301.96s -> 302.96s]  times.
[302.96s -> 307.88s]  Dan is the co-founder of Beastmaker, the company that he started along with Ned Feely,
[307.88s -> 310.76s]  making some of the most popular hangboards in the world.
[310.76s -> 313.60s]  I'm sure you've seen the Beastmaker hangboards.
[313.60s -> 317.92s]  And if you enjoyed my episode with Ned, I'm sure you'll love this conversation with Dan
[317.92s -> 319.68s]  as well.
[319.68s -> 323.96s]  These guys started a hangboard company because they are total geeks about finger training,
[323.96s -> 326.64s]  and that really comes through in this conversation.
[326.64s -> 330.92s]  This is probably the geekiest conversation I've ever had on the podcast about finger
[330.92s -> 331.92s]  training.
[332.36s -> 333.44s]  I found it super useful.
[333.44s -> 336.56s]  And if you're a geek like me, you'll love this one.
[336.56s -> 339.84s]  If you're sick of hearing about finger training, you can probably skip this one.
[339.84s -> 340.84s]  That's okay.
[340.84s -> 341.84s]  It's not for everybody.
[341.84s -> 343.20s]  But yeah, Dan's amazing.
[343.20s -> 346.42s]  He's also an incredibly high level boulderer himself.
[346.42s -> 347.60s]  He's incredibly accomplished.
[347.60s -> 351.12s]  I talk about some of his accomplishments in the start of the episode, so I won't cover
[351.12s -> 352.86s]  them too much here.
[352.86s -> 355.44s]  But this guy does it all when it comes to bouldering.
[355.44s -> 361.84s]  He's put up tons of hard first ascents, really impressive, scary highballs, you name it.
[361.84s -> 365.40s]  He's really, really well-rounded and really consistent with his bouldering, and he knows
[365.40s -> 367.34s]  what he's talking about.
[367.34s -> 371.88s]  He also spent a bunch of years coaching Aiden Roberts, who is an up-and-coming crusher from
[371.88s -> 374.88s]  the UK, one of the strongest boulderers in the world.
[374.88s -> 379.76s]  And we talked about some of the things that Dan has now learned from Aiden in this conversation.
[379.76s -> 384.72s]  But the bulk of this conversation was actually about a finger strength test that Dan had me
[384.72s -> 387.44s]  do before doing this interview.
[387.44s -> 393.48s]  Dan had me test every single one of my fingers individually in both a full crimped position
[393.48s -> 399.28s]  and an open hand position using a sling and lifting weights off the floor one finger at
[399.28s -> 400.28s]  a time.
[400.28s -> 404.80s]  I did that a couple of weeks before doing this interview, sent Dan the results, and
[404.80s -> 407.20s]  then that's a lot of what we talked about.
[407.20s -> 414.56s]  His takeaways from my results, the implications for me, and his recommendations for me.
[414.56s -> 419.24s]  He found that I have two lazy fingers, and so we talked a lot about how to activate lazy
[419.24s -> 421.84s]  fingers that aren't contributing to your grip.
[421.84s -> 425.56s]  So even though this was specific to me, if you're a geek about finger training and you're
[425.56s -> 430.08s]  frustrated or struggling with your finger strength training, I think you'll find something
[430.08s -> 432.40s]  really useful in this conversation.
[432.40s -> 436.58s]  And that reminds me, Dan was also mentioned in the Neil Gresham interview.
[436.58s -> 441.64s]  Dan is the guy that helped Neil Gresham discover some of the weaknesses in his own finger strength
[441.64s -> 446.28s]  and helped him correct them and to work on his half crimp and eventually get that to
[446.28s -> 448.04s]  be balanced with his other grips.
[448.04s -> 451.92s]  That's something that Neil and I talked about in that interview, and Dan is the guy that
[451.92s -> 452.92s]  helped him.
[452.92s -> 458.20s]  So yeah, a super geeky deep dive into finger training in this conversation.
[458.20s -> 463.22s]  We jumped around, covered a couple other topics, but that was the meat of it.
[463.22s -> 465.44s]  And with that, I think we'll dive in.
[465.60s -> 471.12s]  Please enjoy this deep dive into all things finger training with Dan Varian.
[485.12s -> 487.12s]  How's it going, man?
[487.12s -> 489.12s]  Yeah, good.
[489.12s -> 490.12s]  Good.
[490.12s -> 492.12s]  You're in a different spot than last time.
[492.12s -> 493.12s]  Oh, no.
[493.12s -> 494.12s]  Oh, never mind.
[494.80s -> 495.80s]  Nice.
[495.80s -> 500.88s]  Oh, that's a very comfy-looking couch to have in your training room.
[500.88s -> 501.88s]  That's great.
[501.88s -> 508.92s]  Yeah, we just shuffle all the cushions about, just the girls make tunnels out of them and
[508.92s -> 509.92s]  play around.
[509.92s -> 512.92s]  And yeah, you can just like modular room, isn't it?
[512.92s -> 513.92s]  Yeah.
[513.92s -> 514.92s]  Keep it comfy.
[514.92s -> 520.92s]  But I've just been on the fingerboard and stuff just to try and get some references.
[520.92s -> 521.92s]  Awesome.
[521.92s -> 522.92s]  I love it.
[523.72s -> 524.72s]  I love it.
[527.72s -> 529.72s]  Man, what a great room.
[529.72s -> 533.40s]  I also think it's really funny that you don't have any sort of, like you just have a pile
[533.40s -> 536.92s]  of couch cushions on the floor for your crash mats.
[536.92s -> 541.92s]  I think that's pretty, pretty funny given like how long you've been doing this.
[541.92s -> 548.60s]  Oh, it's sticking with the kind of British out the skip spirit there.
[548.60s -> 549.60s]  They're all like leftovers.
[549.80s -> 554.32s]  When we moved into this house, we got left two sofas, so I just took all the cushions
[554.32s -> 555.32s]  in there.
[555.32s -> 560.88s]  The main thing where we've kept them is like I've got a full-size gym mat in the garage
[560.88s -> 561.88s]  still.
[561.88s -> 568.36s]  But yeah, these work really well just being able to move to one side, do some stuff on
[568.36s -> 571.88s]  the floor, and all pile up and make dens.
[571.88s -> 576.20s]  You know, you can't make a den out of a full, if you get a proper bouldering mat in.
[576.20s -> 578.20s]  Think about the kids.
[578.20s -> 579.20s]  I love it.
[579.80s -> 580.80s]  That's awesome.
[580.80s -> 585.92s]  I prefer making dens and crawling through tunnels nowadays.
[585.92s -> 586.92s]  Versus climbing?
[586.92s -> 589.92s]  Then actually using the board for training.
[589.92s -> 590.92s]  I love it.
[590.92s -> 592.52s]  That's awesome, man.
[592.52s -> 593.52s]  It's good to see you again.
[593.52s -> 599.04s]  I have been very excited about this because I think it promises to be a very valuable
[599.04s -> 602.52s]  conversation for me in particular.
[602.52s -> 605.04s]  And hopefully a lot of, you know, everyone else listening to this gets something out
[605.04s -> 606.04s]  of it too.
[606.04s -> 607.36s]  But yeah, it's good to see you.
[607.36s -> 608.36s]  How are you doing?
[609.36s -> 610.36s]  Yeah, good.
[610.36s -> 615.28s]  Yeah, I thought it would just be something fun.
[615.28s -> 621.04s]  And actually, yeah, I'm really interested to chat about the test you did.
[621.04s -> 630.04s]  And yeah, hopefully it'll be insightful for you, but other people can just sort of vicariously
[630.04s -> 632.00s]  bounce off it and think, oh, that resonates.
[632.00s -> 635.04s]  Or maybe they just think I'm full of rubbish.
[635.04s -> 637.88s]  Yeah, well, let's talk about that.
[638.40s -> 642.60s]  I mean, I think they'll have a hard time thinking you're full of rubbish after they know a little
[642.60s -> 644.04s]  bit about your resume.
[644.04s -> 648.64s]  And I want to take a few minutes just to kind of create the context for this conversation,
[648.64s -> 652.00s]  even though we're going to talk about something really specific here.
[652.00s -> 654.04s]  Actually, I have no idea where this is going to go.
[654.04s -> 657.24s]  I have enough notes in front of me, Dan, to probably talk for about four hours.
[657.24s -> 658.24s]  So we'll see what happens.
[658.24s -> 659.24s]  I don't want to...
[659.24s -> 660.24s]  Dan Bennett's time.
[660.24s -> 661.24s]  Totally.
[661.24s -> 665.60s]  Yeah, I'm already thinking we're going to have to do a couple of these.
[665.60s -> 667.32s]  But you made it easy for me.
[667.76s -> 673.72s]  We talked for a couple hours a few weeks ago, and you were so interested in this one specific
[673.72s -> 678.24s]  part of your own training that you've been focusing on, things that you've learned from
[678.24s -> 682.16s]  working with Aidan Roberts and observed from him and how that's influenced your own climbing.
[682.16s -> 686.32s]  And so you gave me this finger test to do, and I'm so excited.
[686.32s -> 687.32s]  I did the test.
[687.32s -> 688.32s]  I sent you the results.
[688.32s -> 692.28s]  I'm so excited to geek out because we haven't really talked about it yet.
[692.28s -> 697.76s]  But I want to take a few minutes just to give people a little bit of background.
[697.76s -> 702.16s]  I almost get intimidated or it's almost difficult to prepare for an interview with someone like
[702.16s -> 705.00s]  you because there's so many things we could talk about.
[705.00s -> 709.80s]  We could have had a two-hour conversation about first ascents and your process for finding
[709.80s -> 711.16s]  boulders and developing.
[711.16s -> 715.60s]  We could have talked about your mindset for highballs because you've done some really difficult,
[715.60s -> 720.28s]  really scary font style stuff way off the deck.
[720.28s -> 724.72s]  Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I believe you've done like 200 first ascents, 8a and harder.
[724.72s -> 725.72s]  Is that right?
[725.72s -> 726.72s]  Yeah, thereabouts.
[726.72s -> 729.40s]  I stopped counting exactly a while ago.
[729.40s -> 733.20s]  I'd have to add them up, but it'll be about there.
[733.20s -> 734.20s]  That's amazing, man.
[734.20s -> 740.28s]  So for Americans listening, V11 or harder, Dan's done 200 plus roughly first ascents,
[740.28s -> 743.24s]  V11 and harder, which is just amazing.
[743.24s -> 744.88s]  And then you also...
[744.88s -> 745.88s]  Go ahead.
[746.04s -> 747.68s]  They're all in these very black quarters.
[747.68s -> 751.80s]  No one cares about how much rock there is in the world.
[751.80s -> 752.80s]  Yeah.
[752.80s -> 753.80s]  Well, I mean, it's super impressive nonetheless.
[753.80s -> 759.64s]  And I bring that up, I mean, to give you credibility, but also just to provide some context because
[759.64s -> 763.64s]  this is probably going to be the most geeky finger training conversation I've ever had
[763.64s -> 765.52s]  on the podcast, which is saying something.
[765.52s -> 767.84s]  I've done a lot of these.
[767.84s -> 775.20s]  But just knowing that you have the rock experience and that you've devoted so much time to rock,
[775.20s -> 779.88s]  you also started Beastmaker with Ned Feely and have one of the most popular hangboard
[779.88s -> 782.24s]  companies in the world.
[782.24s -> 787.92s]  All that to say, we could be talking about so many things and we could be talking about
[787.92s -> 791.44s]  your tactics and your bouldering strategy and things like that.
[791.44s -> 794.64s]  So let's start with Aiden Roberts, actually.
[794.64s -> 797.00s]  I think that'd be a really interesting place to start.
[797.00s -> 801.24s]  I want you to tell me a little bit about who Aiden is for people that don't know and what
[801.24s -> 803.28s]  your connection to him is.
[803.36s -> 808.44s]  And what was it that you started to notice about his climbing and specifically the way
[808.44s -> 814.24s]  that he uses his fingers when crimping that made this whole conversation and this topic
[814.24s -> 816.16s]  so interesting to you?
[816.16s -> 818.64s]  All right.
[818.64s -> 825.44s]  I guess with the finger training, I did a little bit of it before I met Aiden.
[825.44s -> 829.88s]  It just really helped unravel our differences.
[829.88s -> 838.04s]  And I sort of solidified it with him and other people up in Cumbria, because I've moved
[838.04s -> 841.64s]  away a bit of geography background.
[841.64s -> 846.24s]  I did live in Sheffield for quite a few years, six years.
[846.24s -> 852.92s]  And I met my wife and we moved further north back to nearer where we both grew up, which
[852.92s -> 857.88s]  is in the north of England where no one lives comparatively, compared to the south.
[857.88s -> 858.88s]  But there's a lot of rock up here.
[858.88s -> 860.68s]  So it's good fun.
[860.68s -> 865.68s]  And luckily for me, there's still lots of keen rock climbers out here.
[865.68s -> 870.80s]  And Aiden was one of those climbers I met when he was really young.
[870.80s -> 873.64s]  He was like 14, I think, when I first met him.
[873.64s -> 874.64s]  How old is he now?
[874.64s -> 875.64s]  Oh, a question.
[875.64s -> 876.64s]  I think Aiden is 23 now.
[876.64s -> 877.64s]  Okay.
[877.64s -> 878.64s]  And how old are you, Dan?
[878.64s -> 879.64s]  35.
[879.64s -> 880.64s]  35.
[880.64s -> 881.64s]  Okay.
[881.64s -> 882.64s]  Getting there.
[882.64s -> 883.64s]  I'm 33.
[883.64s -> 884.64s]  So I'm 33.
[884.64s -> 893.48s]  Still getting better, though.
[893.48s -> 894.72s]  And it sounds like you are too.
[894.72s -> 897.76s]  So yeah, plenty of hard climbing ahead.
[897.76s -> 898.76s]  Yeah.
[898.76s -> 904.04s]  I'm just fighting the decline, mate, with the kids.
[904.04s -> 911.88s]  But I'm having to get smarter and a lot of this feeds into, they all tie together.
[911.88s -> 913.76s]  So I've got less time nowadays.
[913.88s -> 916.72s]  So I'm having to zone in on things.
[916.72s -> 921.24s]  And with the little time that I have now, it's fun trying to play the training game.
[921.24s -> 926.32s]  Because actually, I've been in the position in my early 20s after uni where I had all
[926.32s -> 929.96s]  the week to lay out my training and do tons of stuff.
[929.96s -> 938.04s]  And back in the mid 2000s and early 2000s, putting up hard stuff around Sheffield, I
[938.04s -> 939.36s]  was in that position.
[939.36s -> 943.84s]  And now I'm in the position where I'm lucky if I get an hour and a half after the kids
[943.84s -> 946.28s]  are in bed before I'm too tired.
[946.28s -> 949.64s]  And I get like a day on the weekend, but I'd like to go out that day.
[949.64s -> 953.80s]  So it has to be raining, really.
[953.80s -> 957.80s]  So yeah, it's changed over the years, but I'm zoning in.
[957.80s -> 961.12s]  So to keep it on track.
[961.12s -> 968.44s]  With kind of like the finger mapping, essentially, I'm always in favor of detail over vagueness,
[968.52s -> 969.72s]  because it sets you off.
[969.72s -> 975.04s]  And the reason why I wanted to just kind of, because obviously your podcast is training
[975.04s -> 980.64s]  related, but what I like is it also seems to follow a little bit of your own journey
[980.64s -> 981.64s]  through climbing.
[981.64s -> 986.48s]  And like you speak to guests, and then you go away and you try stuff and see if it works.
[986.48s -> 994.44s]  And I like that process, because that fits my kind of own anecdotal, you know, you just
[994.44s -> 996.76s]  sort of tinker and see what works for you.
[997.28s -> 999.32s]  It's not everybody's advice.
[999.32s -> 1006.60s]  You know, we all do things similarly, but also different enough to create those differences
[1006.60s -> 1011.96s]  that mean we're not all on camp sport day in, day out, and we're not all doing four
[1011.96s -> 1013.68s]  by fours and things like that.
[1013.68s -> 1020.52s]  And there's enough variance in the niche to create like quite different athletes.
[1021.52s -> 1027.36s]  And that's something Ned said in his book really well is, you know, if we all had the
[1027.36s -> 1034.32s]  perfect answer by now, like they do for, I mean, like a lot of strength sports and things
[1034.32s -> 1040.16s]  are a bit more defined, like how, if you want to PB on your deadlift, the manner in which
[1040.16s -> 1047.64s]  you build up to it and focus on it will likely have a lot less variance than say, trying
[1047.64s -> 1051.52s]  to climb your first day, a boulder, because that could be, you know, anything could be
[1051.52s -> 1060.76s]  jewel could be rainbow rocket dubious, but it could be, uh, you know, like, I don't
[1060.76s -> 1062.40s]  know, a 30 move Trevor.
[1063.88s -> 1067.28s]  So the variance in climate is massive depending on the goal.
[1067.76s -> 1074.84s]  And then obviously that sets our training just into sort of, uh, just this, um, split
[1074.84s -> 1078.60s]  stream of so many different paths to try and arrive at the same place.
[1078.60s -> 1087.96s]  So, um, yeah, so with, with fingers, it's, uh, what I like to look at is basically how
[1087.96s -> 1091.16s]  the strength flows through your hand because it's our starting point.
[1091.28s -> 1094.72s]  And I thought with this podcast, it should be, it should always be at the starting
[1094.72s -> 1095.72s]  point of people's training.
[1096.48s -> 1103.08s]  Um, and what kind of bugs me is this vagueness of like, or just took a load of weight on
[1103.20s -> 1107.60s]  an edge and you'll get better, which is true, but it's like blunderbuss and rifle.
[1107.96s -> 1115.88s]  And, um, like to me, the, the foundations of what lies in your hand should be
[1115.88s -> 1120.48s]  established before you do that, because should you be provided with that knowledge?
[1120.84s -> 1127.88s]  Um, hopefully you could just get better, quicker, basically, which is what people
[1127.88s -> 1131.56s]  really want to do when the training is like, they don't want to, if you said, Oh,
[1131.56s -> 1135.96s]  you can spend 10 years and make slow progress, or you can spend like two years
[1135.96s -> 1141.04s]  to make faster progress, who's going to pick the first option, you know, unless
[1141.72s -> 1145.60s]  you really enjoy what you're doing and sort of growing slowly.
[1145.68s -> 1150.20s]  Um, and I think through climbing in general, if you look back through the
[1150.20s -> 1154.84s]  history, essentially, that's all we've done, we've got gradually smarter in the
[1154.84s -> 1157.24s]  way we train and what we pay attention to.
[1157.56s -> 1160.28s]  And that's how we're standing on the shoulders of past generations and
[1160.28s -> 1160.76s]  progressing.
[1161.52s -> 1163.40s]  And I still think there's plenty of legroom in it.
[1163.76s -> 1166.80s]  I don't think, you know, this is still a fledgling sport.
[1167.36s -> 1173.60s]  So the scientific studies into how we train, you know, scant compared to other
[1173.60s -> 1174.52s]  Olympic sports.
[1174.60s -> 1175.12s]  Right.
[1176.32s -> 1181.40s]  Um, but what I do love is, um, the fact that that's still full of tinkering.
[1181.40s -> 1187.80s]  So I can sit up here way, you know, in my own little quiet part of the world with
[1187.80s -> 1193.40s]  just a few mates, but we can make fun progress and, um, Aiden's just like
[1193.40s -> 1198.16s]  ridiculously surpassed what someone paid attention to those training things.
[1198.20s -> 1200.52s]  I like he's, he's built on loads of things.
[1200.52s -> 1204.64s]  So like, I'm not, I wouldn't want to take credit for Hayden's ability and that
[1204.64s -> 1207.72s]  he's done so much himself and I'm learning from him now.
[1207.76s -> 1212.48s]  So it's like, it's, it's a reversal of the process in terms of many things.
[1212.60s -> 1216.92s]  Um, but what I think we both really share in common is attention to detail and we
[1216.92s -> 1218.48s]  can communicate really well with it.
[1219.32s -> 1225.36s]  And, uh, and it works like I am getting better at the specific things I want to
[1225.36s -> 1231.32s]  get better at because I can have a quick chat and look, I'm lucky enough to sort
[1231.32s -> 1235.20s]  of climb with my mate, but, um, back when I was in Sheffield, it's the same thing.
[1235.24s -> 1238.68s]  And that's one thing I'd really stress to people is that if you can make the effort
[1238.68s -> 1244.36s]  to train with people that are like minded or similar abilities, you
[1244.36s -> 1245.36s]  don't even have to like them.
[1247.44s -> 1252.12s]  People, people probably don't like me, but, um, they'll put up with me because
[1252.12s -> 1253.00s]  it might learn the other thing.
[1253.08s -> 1253.52s]  I don't know.
[1253.76s -> 1255.76s]  But, um, he seemed like a friendly guy.
[1256.68s -> 1258.16s]  It's, it's really beneficial.
[1258.40s -> 1262.48s]  You know, it's, uh, like I, I learned so much when I was training with
[1262.48s -> 1267.28s]  Matt and vice versa and we, we, we fed off each other and our house in general
[1267.28s -> 1271.96s]  then was great because I also lived with Dave Mason when, uh, after uni in Sheffield.
[1273.32s -> 1274.68s]  Good climber called Ben Thompson.
[1275.52s -> 1278.32s]  So we had like a great house to bounce around with.
[1278.64s -> 1284.60s]  Um, uh, just like, you know, how we were training, just the general buzz when
[1284.60s -> 1288.36s]  you sat on the couch and what you're discussing, you don't realize at the
[1288.36s -> 1291.76s]  time, but it's actually, it was, it was great fun and you learn a lot.
[1292.68s -> 1294.96s]  And yeah, just that that's invaluable.
[1294.96s -> 1297.96s]  So it's been nice to have people up here and it's not, not just Aidan.
[1297.96s -> 1300.16s]  There's a lot of other good climbers up here.
[1300.28s -> 1305.28s]  Um, some of which it doesn't tend, it's quite hard to live where I do.
[1305.36s -> 1309.20s]  And, um, Aidan's also quite lucky in that he's grown up here.
[1309.20s -> 1314.16s]  So, you know, some parts of the world are just trickier to, to live in.
[1314.44s -> 1318.92s]  If you can't get the job established and get the other parts of life
[1318.92s -> 1326.08s]  that you want to do to, and, um, and that's why I bet loads of people
[1326.08s -> 1329.80s]  would love to live in Rocklands, but we're not making it work, you know,
[1332.80s -> 1333.40s]  things like that.
[1333.40s -> 1336.64s]  So we're quite, we are quite lucky to be where we are.
[1336.72s -> 1339.76s]  And the other thing that is very important about this area, which
[1339.76s -> 1343.92s]  should probably be stressed is just how many rock types we have.
[1344.16s -> 1350.12s]  Um, which is quite different and unique to even other parts of the UK,
[1350.12s -> 1354.52s]  which we already have loads of rock types, but I think we have almost every
[1354.52s -> 1356.76s]  rock type at our disposal.
[1356.88s -> 1360.96s]  So if I want to climb on granite, that's similar to Little Cottonwood,
[1361.40s -> 1365.72s]  I've got like areas in the Lake District, which are like, there's
[1365.72s -> 1369.48s]  nowhere near the quantity, but there are just little pockets of
[1369.48s -> 1373.88s]  quality and granite, granite, you know, it's, so there's, there's been
[1373.88s -> 1378.04s]  some really good problems over there that I've got to enjoy, um, over the
[1378.04s -> 1383.32s]  years and then sandstone, I'm spoiled for loads of good sandstone, gritstone,
[1383.84s -> 1388.08s]  slate, limestone, different volcanics and the sites, rhyolite.
[1388.68s -> 1394.32s]  Um, so, and, and there, the, the volcanic rock types are closer.
[1394.44s -> 1397.56s]  They're more like central Lake District and that's where Aiden lives.
[1397.56s -> 1400.80s]  So we, we live in slightly different parts of the county, but in American
[1400.80s -> 1403.00s]  terms, we're like next door neighbors.
[1404.36s -> 1405.96s]  We're only like 40 minutes from each other.
[1406.08s -> 1406.44s]  Okay.
[1407.20s -> 1407.44s]  Okay.
[1407.44s -> 1407.96s]  Pretty close.
[1408.56s -> 1409.36s]  Let me jump in.
[1409.36s -> 1413.00s]  Um, this, I mean, this is amazing, but I want to get back to Aiden and
[1413.00s -> 1416.68s]  the high angle crimp thing, um, and hear a little bit more about that.
[1416.68s -> 1418.88s]  But I want to fill in a little context about some of the
[1418.88s -> 1419.96s]  things you just touched on.
[1419.96s -> 1424.92s]  So I love your blunderbuss rifle analogy and actually just listen to
[1424.92s -> 1426.72s]  the interview you did on lattice.
[1426.76s -> 1428.28s]  Just refresh that for me.
[1428.76s -> 1433.12s]  Um, I think that came out last month in July, so, um, and a great
[1433.12s -> 1436.36s]  conversation for people that want to learn more about you, but yeah, so
[1436.36s -> 1439.16s]  you, you were basically saying like, you know, the blunderbuss approach
[1439.16s -> 1442.88s]  is we go to the climbing gym and we climb and we do hit on things in
[1442.88s -> 1445.16s]  our fingers that make us stronger.
[1445.64s -> 1449.36s]  But, you know, the contrast is, is getting on the fingerboard and
[1449.36s -> 1451.04s]  doing something very, very specific.
[1451.04s -> 1456.00s]  And that's more like the precision of having a rifle and it's, I love
[1456.00s -> 1459.08s]  that and you've basically done that again, you know, now you're thinking
[1459.08s -> 1461.68s]  about general fingerboarding is the blunderbuss and you've made your
[1461.68s -> 1466.08s]  finger training much, much more specific, which is really interesting
[1466.08s -> 1469.32s]  to me in particular, because I have these, uh, and I talk about this
[1469.32s -> 1474.60s]  ad nauseum on the podcast, but I have these like major weaknesses in certain
[1474.60s -> 1476.16s]  grip types and in my finger strength.
[1476.16s -> 1480.04s]  And after talking to Ned, it's really become a lot more clear to me that
[1480.48s -> 1484.60s]  just active gripping in general is something that I have really neglected
[1484.64s -> 1488.28s]  and really struggle with and could really benefit from focusing on.
[1488.84s -> 1492.80s]  Um, because I've always learned, I've always climbed really passively.
[1492.80s -> 1496.52s]  I've always relied on friction and, you know, nuancing all the handholds
[1496.52s -> 1499.80s]  and hanging on my skin as much as possible and things like that.
[1500.44s -> 1503.12s]  Um, so I think you're going to be able to provide me some tools
[1503.12s -> 1505.48s]  to focus my training on that.
[1505.96s -> 1509.24s]  But getting back to Aidan, um, one thing I wanted to mention is that
[1509.24s -> 1510.84s]  you coached him for a long time.
[1512.40s -> 1516.56s]  And, uh, the only person you've ever coached.
[1516.56s -> 1516.92s]  Okay.
[1516.96s -> 1517.40s]  Yeah.
[1517.64s -> 1517.92s]  Yeah.
[1518.24s -> 1523.24s]  I'm not coach, but, um, uh, in a proper Cumbrian casual way.
[1523.52s -> 1523.84s]  Yeah.
[1523.84s -> 1527.44s]  I, um, I did a couple of years and more mentoring really.
[1527.72s -> 1532.08s]  And, um, just kind of, yeah, like a couple of years of mentoring.
[1532.52s -> 1539.32s]  Um, uh, maybe I can't remember how many years it was now, but it's kind of ongoing.
[1539.32s -> 1540.44s]  It's just more casual now.
[1540.68s -> 1544.72s]  So it was only like, it was like official for a couple of years, but
[1544.72s -> 1549.48s]  actually after a while I was like, let's just, I can't bother charging you anymore.
[1550.12s -> 1552.64s]  We'll just crack on and go out climbing.
[1552.64s -> 1556.56s]  And, uh, and, and yeah, to be honest, you should probably charge me now.
[1559.80s -> 1562.12s]  But I mean, that's, that's what's cool.
[1562.12s -> 1564.84s]  Well, what's been nice is actually, if you look at it this way, it's just
[1564.84s -> 1569.92s]  kind of like, I think he's taken all the good points and the, maybe some
[1569.92s -> 1574.60s]  of the good advice and ignored all the stupid things I told him and done them
[1575.20s -> 1582.28s]  well and got himself like a lot better base in terms of an athletic, more
[1582.28s -> 1585.48s]  balanced base, which all the younger climbers seem to be doing now, whereas
[1585.48s -> 1589.92s]  I'm old enough to have been more about just going climbing and trying hard.
[1590.64s -> 1594.24s]  And I'm scrambling hard in my thirties to try and achieve a bit more balanced
[1594.24s -> 1596.16s]  just to avoid injury and things like that.
[1596.80s -> 1602.56s]  Um, but, uh, yeah, so for, through that process, uh, we've learned a lot.
[1602.64s -> 1608.36s]  So if you want to talk about, um, crimp angles and things and finger power, I
[1608.36s -> 1614.04s]  don't know that stems from what, like, this is what's fascinating to me in
[1614.04s -> 1617.40s]  climbing is what everyone finds their niche.
[1617.64s -> 1621.64s]  Um, I'm really interested to ask you a bunch of things actually about how you
[1621.64s -> 1626.72s]  got into climbing because I'm with your finger strength stuff, um, I'll tell
[1626.72s -> 1629.84s]  you what, I'll wrap this up and then if we move on to that, I'd be dead interested.
[1631.20s -> 1631.56s]  Yeah.
[1631.92s -> 1636.56s]  Uh, you say you're dead in a passive, um, hangs and things.
[1636.68s -> 1642.36s]  And I just wonder if your path into climbing was, um, more through like
[1642.36s -> 1647.92s]  a slow methodical movement on sport routes and things, and just like a bit
[1647.92s -> 1654.52s]  slower paced to me that would be reflected in contact strengths and the
[1654.52s -> 1659.32s]  way certain aspects of your finger strengths have developed bit like in
[1659.32s -> 1661.76s]  our last conversation where I was telling you about the old track climbers
[1661.76s -> 1665.80s]  and things, because actually that's a really unique and different path into
[1665.80s -> 1671.20s]  climbing than most people have nowadays, which is explosive gym boulders and
[1671.20s -> 1671.76s]  things like that.
[1672.32s -> 1680.24s]  Uh, so, but anyway, so to kind of finish the point on the differences, um, I
[1680.24s -> 1684.20s]  think you can only really with the, the finger sling test you went away and
[1684.20s -> 1689.40s]  did after our last conversation, you can pick through a lot of differences
[1689.40s -> 1692.80s]  and details that I just think help establish a nice foundation.
[1692.84s -> 1697.92s]  And then when you get kind of freaky strong climbers, I think you can really
[1697.92s -> 1702.00s]  pull out the beginnings of why they're different through that test, because
[1702.00s -> 1706.24s]  we always connect through the hands and if it might not show in the fingers,
[1706.24s -> 1709.56s]  if, um, but that in itself is data.
[1709.68s -> 1713.16s]  Um, it, it, that would tell me, or they might have really strong risks to
[1713.16s -> 1714.00s]  climb on sandstone.
[1714.00s -> 1715.12s]  They're amazing at compression.
[1715.20s -> 1717.68s]  They've got body power and that's how you get around it.
[1718.76s -> 1722.96s]  Whereas for some climbers, it's like, it's a huge weapon.
[1723.08s -> 1728.16s]  And actually for me, I've probably been over reliant on pretty strong fingers
[1728.56s -> 1734.44s]  and underdeveloped and loads of other aspects, which is why like, you know,
[1734.72s -> 1737.84s]  I'm not like an athletic physique and I've probably like got the most.
[1738.44s -> 1744.20s]  Left from, I have had in the past, like for doing, uh, I don't know,
[1745.36s -> 1749.20s]  eight B pluses back in Sheffield and things went with like, you know,
[1749.28s -> 1751.44s]  muffin top style body fat.
[1754.24s -> 1758.44s]  I'm not like, I've never been like, uh, sort of just like a, a sort of
[1758.44s -> 1763.40s]  reiki and honest of a physique to me because of the way I've approached
[1763.40s -> 1767.20s]  climbing and climbing and my strengths.
[1767.32s -> 1770.24s]  Um, I'm a pure outdoor climber.
[1770.48s -> 1774.48s]  I just kind of want to be out on the rocks and then, but I also take
[1774.48s -> 1779.16s]  training seriously because of the gaps between the rocks being a huge draw and
[1779.16s -> 1780.56s]  a focus and where I've grown up.
[1781.72s -> 1785.24s]  I've had been lucky enough to have lots of climbers in the area.
[1785.52s -> 1789.56s]  Um, you know, like really good ex world cup climbers and outdoor
[1789.56s -> 1792.84s]  boulders, um, have put up lots of problems I've been able to repeat.
[1792.84s -> 1798.64s]  So, and we're lucky in the UK to have had that history from, um, you know,
[1798.72s -> 1803.04s]  even the peak curtain, uh, Jerry Moffett, Ben Moon, Malcolm Smith,
[1803.04s -> 1808.24s]  Andy L have all had a huge influence in the north of the UK, um, on the boulders.
[1809.32s -> 1816.68s]  Um, and then to, uh, be able to sort of draw from that training influences.
[1817.56s -> 1821.60s]  It's been great, but for me, it's always been all well, how can I
[1821.64s -> 1824.92s]  solve the remaining gaps if I'm going to keep outdoor climbing, which
[1825.36s -> 1826.88s]  locally, that's what you have to do.
[1827.52s -> 1831.52s]  So you get forced to develop the skills to solve the remaining gaps.
[1831.76s -> 1835.52s]  And locally, Aiden's just carried on with that process in the lakes.
[1836.24s -> 1840.16s]  Um, but the rate that he's hoovered them up has been really staggering.
[1840.64s -> 1846.52s]  Yeah, but it's with the special attributes and then just to take it on, like, so to
[1846.76s -> 1852.12s]  crunch some data switch data, which people do loves like in a high angle.
[1853.16s -> 1858.84s]  Pinky sling, I'd say he's probably got the world record for like lifting
[1858.84s -> 1860.24s]  on there with the under your pinky.
[1860.40s -> 1864.48s]  And that's like close nigh on 20 kilos, like solid 19.
[1865.44s -> 1868.44s]  And then you'll know from your own tests, like just how much extra power
[1868.44s -> 1871.08s]  and how hard that feels when the weight doesn't lift off the floor.
[1871.96s -> 1876.04s]  Um, now what was really exciting for me just then is cause I wanted to.
[1876.52s -> 1878.80s]  Just make sure I have a decent frame of reference because I haven't done
[1878.80s -> 1880.24s]  any of these tests in a little while.
[1880.92s -> 1885.76s]  I just lifted 10 kilos off the floor with my pinky, like it wasn't there.
[1886.00s -> 1891.00s]  So it shows me my, cause I used to like warm up below that and just make sure.
[1891.04s -> 1895.60s]  Whereas I just started at that weight just to say, and, um, yeah, so the
[1895.60s -> 1899.48s]  gains over the years from when I first started coaching, when actually my
[1899.48s -> 1902.40s]  pinky was a very similar strength to yours and your tests, which I think
[1902.40s -> 1904.92s]  came out around eight or nine kilos, wasn't it?
[1905.28s -> 1908.56s]  And, um, sorry to Americans for using kilos.
[1909.48s -> 1909.96s]  It's okay.
[1909.96s -> 1910.84s]  I'll convert.
[1911.44s -> 1911.72s]  Yeah.
[1912.52s -> 1918.48s]  Um, yeah, in, in those years by a bit of targeted training, I'm now up to sort
[1918.48s -> 1922.96s]  of, and I'm not, I'm quite far off my best at the minute for various reasons,
[1922.96s -> 1930.24s]  lots of DIY and just general, um, lack of like proper on it training.
[1930.64s -> 1936.48s]  Um, but yeah, no, I was really happy in that sort of 13 went up fine and I was
[1936.48s -> 1940.32s]  like, oh, well that'll do for today just for like frame of reference case.
[1940.44s -> 1943.60s]  And, um, cause that's already like a big win for me.
[1943.68s -> 1947.84s]  So actually, and that's what I think these tests, I don't think this is a
[1947.84s -> 1953.68s]  great way of training, but I think it's a fascinating way of gaining insight
[1953.72s -> 1955.16s]  and checking that things are working.
[1956.48s -> 1956.76s]  Okay.
[1956.76s -> 1957.76s]  Let me, let me jump in.
[1958.08s -> 1960.92s]  We owe our listeners a bunch of context before we get too
[1960.92s -> 1962.08s]  swept away in this thing.
[1962.56s -> 1966.88s]  Um, so just to close the loop on Aiden Roberts for people that don't know who
[1966.88s -> 1970.16s]  this guy is and Aiden, if you're listening, I would love to have you on the show.
[1970.80s -> 1972.96s]  Um, I'm so inspired by you, but yeah.
[1972.96s -> 1977.80s]  So Aiden's in his early twenties and he's really becoming clearly one
[1977.80s -> 1979.52s]  of the best boulders in the world.
[1979.76s -> 1981.24s]  He's so strong.
[1981.24s -> 1985.24s]  He's particularly good at really small hold crimp climbing.
[1985.96s -> 1990.52s]  And, uh, he's training for burden of dreams right now, the Nali Hukutaival V17.
[1991.00s -> 1994.04s]  And he's, it's definitely seems like he's got a shot at doing this thing.
[1994.04s -> 1995.84s]  So he's, he's at that level.
[1996.48s -> 2000.60s]  And, um, one thing I want you to define really quickly, Dan,
[2000.60s -> 2001.96s]  cause we didn't talk about this.
[2002.64s -> 2005.84s]  I hadn't really heard the term actually, before I talked to you, it's, I can
[2005.84s -> 2009.08s]  kind of intuit what it means, but I know some people are going to be confused,
[2009.08s -> 2014.96s]  but what is a high angle crimp and what is it that you see when Aiden
[2014.96s -> 2019.52s]  climbs, um, how does it express when Aiden climbs, if that makes sense?
[2020.44s -> 2021.92s]  That's the funny thing about climbing, isn't it?
[2021.92s -> 2024.72s]  Everyone's got their own terminology for stuff a little bit, because it's
[2024.72s -> 2029.16s]  still niche enough that these things are developing in their own separate clusters.
[2029.32s -> 2037.68s]  Um, so, um, like basically we discount the thumb in almost all of our training.
[2038.24s -> 2043.04s]  And once you discount the thumb, you have loads of options of finger angles.
[2043.64s -> 2046.96s]  Whereas people often just talk about full crimp and half crimp.
[2047.04s -> 2051.80s]  But the problem with that is there's too many, just too much differentiation.
[2052.16s -> 2055.96s]  And there's a, there's a whole world of difference between taking
[2055.96s -> 2058.24s]  your thumb off and putting it on.
[2058.68s -> 2064.00s]  And, and actually when it's off, um, most people, when they half
[2064.00s -> 2065.52s]  crimp will never bend that pinky.
[2065.64s -> 2072.36s]  And the pinky is one of the key focal points of, um, transferring power.
[2073.00s -> 2074.48s]  In a, in a crimp position.
[2075.56s -> 2081.28s]  And the reason why that is, is in terms of pinky and index, which can also get
[2081.28s -> 2086.88s]  lazy and go into a chisel is it all depends on load, load capacity and
[2087.16s -> 2089.24s]  access to the income in the hold.
[2089.96s -> 2091.80s]  And a lot of this depends on loci.
[2092.40s -> 2094.84s]  So at what point the hold is out from your body.
[2095.56s -> 2099.28s]  And then that depends on what grip is useful, but also as the grip comes in,
[2100.12s -> 2105.12s]  how quick you want to move all depends on your load capacity of your
[2105.12s -> 2107.92s]  fingers in a high angle position.
[2107.92s -> 2111.96s]  So the ability to access the income in the back of the hold, if you're not
[2111.96s -> 2115.00s]  doing that and you're dragging over the front of the holds and generating
[2115.00s -> 2118.60s]  power by pulling underneath through it, you won't be able to move
[2118.60s -> 2120.12s]  above the holes with control.
[2120.52s -> 2124.32s]  So what people tend to do that climbing that style is load up and
[2124.32s -> 2128.80s]  then move dynamically hold to hold and sort of explode and flick up there
[2128.80s -> 2129.92s]  and then catch the other one.
[2130.52s -> 2131.24s]  And that's great.
[2131.24s -> 2134.84s]  If your fingers take a high amount of load and a non-failure grip.
[2135.16s -> 2138.32s]  So chisel or drag tends to be those grips.
[2138.44s -> 2142.28s]  And if you're really lucky, you'll be one of the people that can maybe hang
[2142.60s -> 2144.20s]  large amounts of both your body weight.
[2144.80s -> 2148.12s]  Uh, in a half grip position, which is also incredibly useful.
[2148.76s -> 2152.48s]  And there's, there's loads of ways that, um, not loads of ways, but there are,
[2152.76s -> 2156.44s]  there are many ways of achieving that great finger strength that
[2156.52s -> 2157.76s]  reflects on your style.
[2158.16s -> 2164.68s]  So I know good at boulders that don't have a very strong pinky, but there's
[2164.68s -> 2168.72s]  often like silver bullet attributes that just mean they can walk
[2168.72s -> 2170.52s]  up to problems and nail them.
[2171.24s -> 2176.88s]  So with regards to your results, like you're kind of missing two silver
[2176.88s -> 2180.36s]  bullets, but you've got some really other, you've got some other great
[2180.36s -> 2182.80s]  attributes and balances that people would kill to have.
[2183.56s -> 2190.92s]  Um, but so one just classic, um, thing, which a lot of good climbers
[2190.92s -> 2195.20s]  have is so that kind of half crimp dead hang and we see loads of people
[2195.20s -> 2196.76s]  hanging on one arm on finger board.
[2197.92s -> 2203.44s]  90% of the time, the pinkies taken at least 25 to 30 kilos of their body
[2203.44s -> 2204.68s]  weight because it's straight.
[2204.84s -> 2206.72s]  And then the other bent fingers make up the rest.
[2207.56s -> 2212.44s]  And so that, that pinky mono ability, which then you see people do in
[2212.64s -> 2214.20s]  can do pinky monofront leavers.
[2214.20s -> 2215.08s]  It's like, yeah, no shit.
[2215.08s -> 2217.72s]  Cause all your dead hanging has been like essentially training you
[2217.72s -> 2219.24s]  pinky to hang in a mono position.
[2219.88s -> 2222.12s]  It's like, it's your other fingers that will be crapping like a
[2222.12s -> 2223.36s]  half grip most of the time.
[2223.56s -> 2227.88s]  And that's so like you can overgeneralize like that and it's quite true, but then
[2227.88s -> 2232.00s]  you can meet people, you know, like I've spoken to Jim Pope a bit and he actually
[2232.00s -> 2236.88s]  has a weak pinky and confront free half crimp that hadn't, but struggles
[2236.88s -> 2238.12s]  to get much out of his pinky.
[2238.64s -> 2241.92s]  And it's just the way people develop as they go as they climb.
[2241.92s -> 2246.00s]  And, and this is why I wanted to do that test with you to sort of discuss some
[2246.08s -> 2251.44s]  actual useful stuff, hopefully, because, um, you can go through life
[2251.44s -> 2255.68s]  and this is like everything you can, if you just kind of skip past the
[2255.68s -> 2259.40s]  intricacies and the analytics and the details, and you can just go training.
[2260.16s -> 2261.68s]  Um, it's great fun.
[2262.24s -> 2264.20s]  It like it, it's really good fun.
[2264.40s -> 2271.72s]  And, uh, but you might miss massive black holes and, um, it's quite obvious
[2271.72s -> 2276.76s]  sometimes that cause like, once you get into this type of way of looking at
[2276.76s -> 2284.28s]  details, um, it starts to explain things and then you can't like, uh,
[2284.40s -> 2285.72s]  you can't magic that strength.
[2285.76s -> 2290.56s]  So I can't just trick a test and like lift over 15 kilos with my
[2290.56s -> 2295.24s]  pinky in like a, in a crimp in a sling that power's just not there.
[2295.44s -> 2300.44s]  But then when I go to put that power on, on a problem, it will show
[2300.44s -> 2301.92s]  up that I'm weaker on crimps.
[2302.40s -> 2303.48s]  Like I can't trick it.
[2303.56s -> 2309.12s]  What I can do is use my styles and attributes to trick the problem and
[2309.12s -> 2310.64s]  to climb on the rock in that style.
[2310.68s -> 2317.16s]  But if I want to climb, sorry, slow and control and be able to grab all the
[2317.16s -> 2322.20s]  holes precisely, like my young friend from the lakes, um, and look like
[2322.20s -> 2329.08s]  a sort of a hydraulic, uh, rock destroyer, like the rocket, like if
[2329.08s -> 2333.28s]  you're, if there's small holes and, uh, rocks, he's aiding coming at the
[2333.28s -> 2336.92s]  minute, then it's, you know, it's just going to think, ah, shit, I should,
[2336.96s -> 2338.12s]  I should've gone with the vague.
[2338.64s -> 2340.08s]  I should've gone with the vague features.
[2340.24s -> 2345.72s]  Like this, this guy's got me, um, it really is the case.
[2345.72s -> 2349.56s]  Like at the moment, it's just mental unstoppable on crimps.
[2350.08s -> 2351.28s]  That's what's cool about climbing.
[2351.28s -> 2355.44s]  There's like, there's so many styles and attributes that all, all, all we have
[2355.44s -> 2359.80s]  to do is like trap eight, eight, and then a little tiger pit with loads of
[2359.80s -> 2361.32s]  fun, eight, eight dinos to get out.
[2361.36s -> 2362.48s]  And he's stuck in there for life.
[2365.52s -> 2366.00s]  I love it.
[2366.04s -> 2366.32s]  Okay.
[2366.32s -> 2367.24s]  Let me jump in again.
[2367.24s -> 2370.40s]  I'm, I'm going to, um, say some things back to you to make sure I'm
[2370.40s -> 2373.84s]  understanding it correctly and fill in some, uh, gaps for listeners.
[2374.28s -> 2378.36s]  So I'll define the high angle crimp thing, um, in my own words.
[2378.36s -> 2381.28s]  And you can tell me if I'm, if I'm getting it right.
[2382.28s -> 2385.72s]  Um, so yeah, for people listening, imagine that your hand is
[2385.72s -> 2387.12s]  in a full crimp position.
[2387.12s -> 2389.12s]  You can wrap your thumb if you want to.
[2390.40s -> 2393.20s]  The high angle crimp is like the most aggressive crimp you would ever use.
[2393.20s -> 2398.64s]  So every single finger is bent at a 90 degree at the pip joint, including your
[2398.64s -> 2400.60s]  pinky, it's really aggressive.
[2400.60s -> 2404.76s]  Your fingertips are almost pointed downward and you would use that.
[2406.24s -> 2406.60s]  Sorry.
[2406.72s -> 2411.72s]  Um, so if it's a really incorporated, your knuckles will be hitting against
[2411.72s -> 2416.32s]  the wall because you'll be, you're accessing whatever the income is.
[2416.40s -> 2421.12s]  So if you're talking like 45, 55 degree in curtain and micro crimp, you just
[2421.12s -> 2423.48s]  go to that angle and then access it.
[2423.48s -> 2425.24s]  So you can pull outwards like it's a joke.
[2426.08s -> 2430.28s]  Um, the problem for most people is your grip will fail because
[2430.28s -> 2432.24s]  there's too many small muscles.
[2432.24s -> 2436.84s]  And if you haven't trained it, if it's not been styled for many years, it will
[2436.84s -> 2441.08s]  just fail and you'll flop back onto a half crimp with likely a pinky or a
[2441.08s -> 2445.56s]  chisel straight, which because of the anchor, you'll still snag on it, but
[2445.56s -> 2448.96s]  yeah, that's, um, so there's no real definition of the angle.
[2449.64s -> 2453.16s]  Um, I would just say what, what I'm saying is you're getting
[2453.16s -> 2454.08s]  into the back of the hole.
[2454.36s -> 2454.60s]  Yeah.
[2454.60s -> 2456.48s]  You're getting into the back of the hold so you can pull
[2456.48s -> 2458.16s]  outward and use that leverage.
[2458.68s -> 2461.56s]  And what you were saying about the pinky before is that most of our
[2461.56s -> 2465.36s]  training, um, just globally as a climbing community, people that are
[2465.48s -> 2469.20s]  obsessed with trying to hang one arm on your beast maker center edge.
[2469.68s -> 2473.88s]  Uh, you know, we, we all love the half current position and a lot of
[2473.88s -> 2475.32s]  people just train in that position.
[2475.32s -> 2479.32s]  But what Dan's saying is that for most of us, just the shorter length of our
[2479.32s -> 2483.64s]  pinky will necessitate that the pinkies in a open position when we're half
[2483.68s -> 2484.16s]  crimping.
[2484.68s -> 2488.64s]  And so we're essentially, no matter how much finger training we're doing, we're
[2488.64s -> 2492.04s]  only ever training our pinky to be straight and never crimped.
[2492.76s -> 2496.80s]  And, um, so I want to take a second to describe the sling test that you had me
[2496.80s -> 2498.68s]  do, and then we can just dive right into it.
[2499.80s -> 2506.24s]  So what Dan, what Dan had me do, um, I took a 12 mil sling, and this is just
[2506.24s -> 2511.56s]  like a Alpine runner that I had in my, in my bag, attached a carabiner to it, loop
[2511.60s -> 2517.52s]  that around a kettlebell and then attach the sling, just slung it over the tip of
[2517.52s -> 2518.28s]  one finger.
[2518.28s -> 2522.80s]  So for instance, my index finger, just right over the tip, as if I were pulling
[2522.80s -> 2526.68s]  on a small, you know, 10 mil edge or something like that, a small little
[2526.68s -> 2534.24s]  crimp, and then put my finger in a aggressive crimp position and then try
[2534.24s -> 2535.68s]  to lift the kettlebell off the floor.
[2535.92s -> 2539.92s]  And then do that with every single finger and just keep going up in the
[2539.92s -> 2543.12s]  weights until I can't lift the kettlebell off the floor anymore.
[2543.12s -> 2549.08s]  So essentially isolating every single one of my eight fingers, I didn't do this
[2549.08s -> 2554.12s]  with my thumbs, um, in a isolated crimp position.
[2554.12s -> 2557.64s]  So I'm testing every single finger on their own in a crimp position.
[2558.08s -> 2564.16s]  And Dan's thinking is that that will, that would help me discover how the
[2564.16s -> 2567.64s]  distribution of the load is coming across my different fingers.
[2567.64s -> 2570.76s]  So basically how each finger is contributing to my finger strength.
[2570.76s -> 2574.52s]  If I'm crimping an edge with four fingers, you know, what's the percentage
[2574.52s -> 2578.28s]  of each, how is each finger contributing to the overall load?
[2578.28s -> 2580.36s]  Like what percentage of my weight is it taking?
[2580.92s -> 2584.12s]  So it was super interesting going back to what you said about Aiden.
[2584.60s -> 2589.00s]  When I crimped with my pinky and lifted a kettlebell off the floor using the sling,
[2589.60s -> 2593.36s]  I think my max was 20 pounds, which is 9.1 kilos.
[2593.88s -> 2596.92s]  And you said that Aiden can do 20 kilos.
[2596.92s -> 2599.40s]  So 44 pounds, about twice where I'm at.
[2599.40s -> 2603.60s]  So just imagine like he's literally, his pinkies are twice as strong as mine.
[2604.04s -> 2606.08s]  And then I'm sure all of his other fingers are stronger too.
[2606.08s -> 2608.60s]  But so yeah, I did this test.
[2609.48s -> 2610.08s]  Um,
[2610.80s -> 2612.68s]  that day it was like two years old as well.
[2612.84s -> 2613.20s]  Okay.
[2613.20s -> 2614.16s]  He's probably even stronger.
[2617.20s -> 2617.68s]  Right.
[2618.40s -> 2620.96s]  So, yeah, I, I, um, I went through this entire test.
[2620.96s -> 2622.96s]  I made a spreadsheet with my results.
[2622.96s -> 2625.76s]  I will share that for you guys in the show notes so you can see it.
[2626.48s -> 2628.16s]  And, um, what do you think we should do, Dan?
[2628.16s -> 2633.08s]  Should we talk about my results, share the numbers and then dive into what they mean?
[2633.08s -> 2635.92s]  Or how do you, how do you want to go from here or where do you want to go from here?
[2637.04s -> 2638.88s]  Should I just break down some key points?
[2639.08s -> 2639.56s]  Yes, please.
[2639.56s -> 2643.80s]  And then, and so first I'll ask, did you learn anything?
[2643.92s -> 2645.92s]  And what do you think?
[2646.80s -> 2647.96s]  Do you think differently?
[2648.36s -> 2650.92s]  Or is this confirmed what you thought about your hands?
[2651.00s -> 2652.52s]  Or have you, has it flagged up anything?
[2653.12s -> 2656.40s]  I think it has confirmed what I thought about my hands.
[2656.56s -> 2660.16s]  Um, which is that they're, they're quite balanced.
[2660.20s -> 2662.92s]  I got the exact same results with my right and left hand.
[2662.96s -> 2668.16s]  And there were a couple lifts that were marginally harder with my left hand, but
[2668.20s -> 2671.84s]  this, it ultimately came out to the same amount of weight lifted off the floor.
[2671.84s -> 2675.16s]  And if I tried to go any heavier, um, that was my max.
[2675.16s -> 2678.16s]  It just felt slightly harder with my left hand, slightly more desperate.
[2679.28s -> 2681.64s]  I mean, I'm pretty far just crunching the numbers and saying,
[2681.64s -> 2684.88s]  you know, if you add them all up to see like how much weight would I
[2684.92s -> 2688.56s]  theoretically be able to hold with one hand in a crimp position?
[2688.56s -> 2692.00s]  It's very far off from body weight, which is not a surprise to me at all.
[2692.04s -> 2697.28s]  You know, I'm, I'm 60 pounds away theoretically from being able to hang
[2697.32s -> 2699.24s]  from one hand on a small crimp.
[2699.92s -> 2707.00s]  Um, but you get, you kind of get there on chisel when you're in, which is open for,
[2707.00s -> 2708.60s]  I think a lot of Americans call it down there.
[2708.60s -> 2708.88s]  Yeah.
[2708.88s -> 2712.92s]  So chisel, I actually misunderstood chisel for a long time, but yeah, it's basically
[2712.92s -> 2717.52s]  open for where your index and your pinky are both straight and then your middle
[2717.52s -> 2719.16s]  two fingers are kind of half crimped.
[2719.60s -> 2719.88s]  Yeah.
[2721.16s -> 2727.04s]  One thing I will say actually is, um, we baked like the way I don't quite have
[2727.04s -> 2733.68s]  the data, I should have said slide the sling back as well to the, um, pip knuckle,
[2733.68s -> 2735.12s]  a bit like the open handed test.
[2735.16s -> 2740.48s]  Because I've kind of got a good insight on you on kind of high angle stuff, which
[2740.48s -> 2744.68s]  I think is really important, especially if you're climbing outside and the open
[2744.68s -> 2748.24s]  day is very, um, good and true as well.
[2748.24s -> 2750.72s]  But I think you would have got slightly higher loads.
[2751.08s -> 2754.44s]  You would have possibly a lot higher loads by sliding that back and just
[2754.48s -> 2759.56s]  having a slightly more open finger angle, which would be, you know, a little bit
[2759.72s -> 2764.68s]  by sliding that back and just having a slightly more open finger angle, which
[2764.68s -> 2766.68s]  would be your half crimp representation.
[2766.76s -> 2773.56s]  So if you want it to do that afterwards, you might, um, get sort of a bit more
[2773.56s -> 2779.64s]  insight as to, um, if anything changes, cause one, cause one of the insights and
[2779.64s -> 2785.56s]  one of the things I really picked up on, uh, with your data was you've got two lazy
[2785.56s -> 2787.68s]  fingers, which are lacking silver bullets.
[2788.00s -> 2788.36s]  Okay.
[2788.36s -> 2792.52s]  One is your middle finger should be pulling your middle fingers.
[2793.00s -> 2795.68s]  Just kind of hanging with the crew and needs to step up.
[2795.68s -> 2801.28s]  It's going, um, it's just like out with the boys and whatever they do, it does.
[2801.96s -> 2807.44s]  Um, whereas it needs to be like the star player and the, the, um, what do
[2807.44s -> 2809.40s]  you Americans call the, uh, the quarterback?
[2809.72s -> 2810.00s]  Yeah.
[2810.08s -> 2810.56s]  Okay.
[2812.76s -> 2815.36s]  The middle finger should always be quite a bit stronger.
[2815.60s -> 2820.28s]  I think in most people I've kind of mucked about with over the years, middle
[2820.28s -> 2821.92s]  finger can normally punch pretty high.
[2822.76s -> 2827.08s]  For me, it was interesting that your middle didn't have loads of distance,
[2827.40s -> 2832.36s]  like clear water in terms of weight, it can pull above the ring and the index.
[2833.28s -> 2837.80s]  Now you'd, you'd expect pinky to be weak, but actually I think so you're on the
[2837.80s -> 2842.08s]  flip side, I think your pinky in a critical position is actually pretty
[2842.08s -> 2843.64s]  strong for where you're at at the minute.
[2844.16s -> 2849.64s]  Um, I was pretty impressed by, in general, you've got a really good
[2849.64s -> 2855.56s]  load spread across your hand, which is great, uh, for like kind of
[2855.60s -> 2857.44s]  evenly loading through small crimps.
[2857.72s -> 2862.88s]  But you sell yourself short because the middle finger and the, probably
[2862.88s -> 2864.08s]  the ring would be the next one.
[2864.08s -> 2866.36s]  I would pick to sort of, that should be targeted.
[2866.48s -> 2870.64s]  It could be the index depending on like they are a little bit interchangeable,
[2871.52s -> 2876.72s]  but certainly the middle finger to me, I would say that in people that say
[2876.72s -> 2881.48s]  would often test with a similar amount of pinky strengths, I might even see
[2881.48s -> 2886.28s]  like 10 kilos, more strength in their middle finger for like that level
[2886.28s -> 2887.36s]  of pink strength that you've got.
[2887.56s -> 2892.12s]  So that's what makes me think actually there's something going on with the way
[2892.12s -> 2895.60s]  your middle fingers being stimulated through, you know, how you've learned
[2896.08s -> 2901.00s]  how your nerves, your sort of that pathway of how you fire through your
[2901.00s -> 2907.48s]  hand, which is meaning that like the, that's why you sort of missing a part of
[2907.48s -> 2911.44s]  the load now, the other part of the load that's missing is when that pinky goes
[2911.44s -> 2917.32s]  straight, that's probably the bigger one is actually, um, that could be pulling
[2917.32s -> 2923.60s]  like 20 kilos more, uh, straight, which to me reflects now, this is the
[2923.60s -> 2928.20s]  interesting thing, cause we've already touched on this in the, on a lot of
[2928.20s -> 2932.52s]  holds outside that wouldn't translate directly, but in terms of training goals,
[2932.60s -> 2936.88s]  it would translate really well on the fingerboard and on steep boards.
[2937.24s -> 2939.28s]  So your main boards and your killer boards.
[2939.28s -> 2949.12s]  And if someone's got one of our bespoke, um, yeah, the, uh, so like the, the
[2949.12s -> 2954.56s]  pinky is an interesting one because I would, how you address that entirely
[2954.56s -> 2958.48s]  depends on what your goals are and I don't know them at the minute.
[2958.52s -> 2964.60s]  So yeah, like what, what do you just want to kind of, some people just want to
[2964.60s -> 2969.24s]  improve and then get better at kind of just get stronger and things on some
[2969.24s -> 2974.88s]  people are all about kind of adapting to what, you know, is on the rock and on
[2974.88s -> 2976.88s]  what their goals are specifically.
[2977.48s -> 2977.88s]  Yeah.
[2979.20s -> 2979.52s]  Yeah.
[2979.52s -> 2982.16s]  Once again, for people that are curious about the numbers, I'll share my
[2982.16s -> 2985.16s]  spreadsheet so you can just see how I tested.
[2985.24s -> 2987.32s]  Um, I want to, I'll, I'll answer your question.
[2987.32s -> 2990.60s]  I will get to that in one second, but just to paint a little bit more of a
[2990.60s -> 2995.76s]  picture, um, so I had these kettlebells and I was going up in kettlebells,
[2995.76s -> 2996.60s]  testing each finger.
[2996.60s -> 3003.28s]  I also had a one kilogram weight, which is two, actually I had a 2.5 pound weight,
[3003.28s -> 3008.56s]  which is just over one kilo and I had a 1.25 pound weight, which is about half a
[3008.56s -> 3009.08s]  kilo.
[3009.64s -> 3013.64s]  Um, so I had those as well and I would attach those to the kettlebells to, to
[3013.64s -> 3018.36s]  make these jumps smaller, um, and make the results a little bit more specific.
[3018.84s -> 3022.08s]  But then for people listening, I'll just share the percentages.
[3022.68s -> 3026.84s]  So if you, if I was in a full crimp position and you know, the, the most I
[3026.84s -> 3032.48s]  could pull potentially with all four fingers is about 112 pounds, 51 kilos.
[3033.40s -> 3035.88s]  22% of that is coming from my index.
[3036.20s -> 3042.52s]  32% of that is coming from my middle, 28% coming from my ring and 18% coming from
[3042.52s -> 3043.28s]  my pinky.
[3043.84s -> 3044.92s]  And so this is really interesting.
[3044.92s -> 3051.04s]  What Dan is saying that is that if, um, if my middle was as strong as he would
[3051.04s -> 3058.28s]  expect it to be relative to my pinky, it should be, you know, pulling 40, 50% or
[3058.28s -> 3062.36s]  something of my weight and, and be, um, you know, 10 kilos more than it is.
[3062.68s -> 3064.36s]  So anyway, just wanted to share that real quick.
[3065.36s -> 3067.56s]  And then now I've forgotten your question.
[3070.52s -> 3070.84s]  Yeah.
[3070.84s -> 3071.12s]  Yeah.
[3071.12s -> 3073.08s]  So no, this is, this is really good.
[3073.08s -> 3073.96s]  This is really important.
[3073.96s -> 3076.28s]  And, um, I do have specific goals.
[3076.32s -> 3077.68s]  I really want to climb.
[3079.28s -> 3081.72s]  I really want to climb some 514s.
[3082.48s -> 3084.24s]  I mean, I, I do just want to get better.
[3084.24s -> 3085.28s]  That's the short answer.
[3085.28s -> 3091.08s]  But what I have noticed is that the limiting factor for me always seems to
[3091.08s -> 3094.60s]  come down to something that's pretty basic.
[3094.64s -> 3098.00s]  It's that type of finger strength that you use when you're climbing on a board.
[3098.40s -> 3099.88s]  It's that active finger strength.
[3099.88s -> 3103.80s]  That's the ability to hang a pretty good edge, like a one pad edge with
[3103.80s -> 3105.00s]  a lot of weight on your hands.
[3105.04s -> 3107.64s]  You know, some of the sport climbs that I've been trying around St.
[3107.64s -> 3111.88s]  George, the limiting factors are not that complicated.
[3111.88s -> 3116.60s]  You know, I just need to be able to hang on some of those holds with a lower
[3116.60s -> 3120.60s]  percentage of my max so that I can do more moves in a row, or so that I can do
[3120.60s -> 3123.24s]  a hard clip and then make the next move or things like that.
[3124.00s -> 3127.32s]  And, um, that's starting to express it in my bouldering as well.
[3127.32s -> 3128.96s]  Like the boulders that I want to do.
[3130.44s -> 3134.20s]  Um, I think I just need stronger fingers to be able to do them.
[3134.20s -> 3139.00s]  And every time I've done any sort of finger strength testing, I'm usually
[3139.00s -> 3143.52s]  performing at a higher grade in bouldering and in sport climbing than you would
[3143.52s -> 3145.04s]  expect based on my finger strength.
[3145.08s -> 3148.56s]  And especially when it comes to like loading up a half crimp
[3148.56s -> 3150.12s]  or something on a decent edge.
[3150.84s -> 3151.92s]  Um, yeah.
[3151.92s -> 3153.24s]  And to, and to take you back further.
[3153.24s -> 3155.80s]  So you asked the question about where I came from in my climbing.
[3156.44s -> 3159.96s]  A lot of my early climbing, it wasn't sport climbing, but it was actually
[3159.96s -> 3161.88s]  very slow controlled climbing.
[3161.92s -> 3165.32s]  I climbed in a gym that was really old school.
[3165.44s -> 3169.92s]  Um, everything was vertical up to like 10 degrees overhanging, lots of old greasy,
[3169.92s -> 3172.08s]  like small crimps and things like that.
[3172.92s -> 3175.00s]  And, um, I just moved like a sloth.
[3175.00s -> 3177.28s]  You know, I started climbing at 18 years old and I had a
[3177.28s -> 3179.20s]  decent amount of body strength.
[3179.24s -> 3184.00s]  Um, I had a background in some weightlifting and some other sports and things.
[3184.92s -> 3188.76s]  So my fingers were always the limiting thing, but I could compensate by moving
[3188.76s -> 3193.60s]  really, really slow and controlled and like take my time to get the hold perfectly.
[3193.60s -> 3194.00s]  You know?
[3194.84s -> 3196.60s]  And, um, and I've always climbed that way.
[3196.60s -> 3201.36s]  And then that was paired with climbing in on granite in Leavenworth, Washington,
[3201.80s -> 3202.88s]  which is very featurey.
[3202.92s -> 3208.12s]  It's a lot of squeezing, it's a lot of compression, it's a lot of tricks, you
[3208.20s -> 3212.00s]  know, um, squeezing between a heel and a hand or things like that.
[3212.56s -> 3215.00s]  And so that combination, go ahead.
[3215.84s -> 3219.84s]  Would you favor chisel on that Leavenworth and things like that?
[3220.32s -> 3221.32s]  Like open four.
[3221.52s -> 3221.96s]  Yeah.
[3222.80s -> 3223.56s]  Yeah, I think so.
[3223.56s -> 3225.56s]  And, and small crimps as well.
[3225.64s -> 3227.40s]  Um, it's interesting.
[3227.40s -> 3231.80s]  Like I always felt like I was pretty decent at small crimping, but not
[3231.80s -> 3233.48s]  with a lot of weight on my hands.
[3233.52s -> 3236.20s]  And then I was pretty good at open hand, but it was everything
[3236.20s -> 3237.56s]  in between that felt really hard.
[3237.56s -> 3242.04s]  So I remember, uh, the first, the first time I climbed on like a 40 degree
[3242.04s -> 3247.16s]  wall or a 45 degree wall on decent holds, this was like a V5 in Joe's Valley.
[3247.16s -> 3248.96s]  And I think I'd climbed V9 at the time.
[3249.32s -> 3249.92s]  Couldn't do it.
[3250.04s -> 3254.80s]  You know, I couldn't climb on like a one, one pad in cut holds in a half
[3254.80s -> 3257.08s]  cramp or any sort of grip position.
[3257.64s -> 3262.64s]  Um, cause I always relied on sneaky ways to get around just hanging on
[3262.64s -> 3264.04s]  my fingers, if that makes sense.
[3265.52s -> 3267.12s]  No, that that's really interesting.
[3267.48s -> 3272.72s]  Cause, uh, um, I would guess that there's a lot of things.
[3273.08s -> 3276.32s]  So, you know how I've said, like, you're missing the silver
[3276.32s -> 3279.72s]  bullets in the fingers, often climbers.
[3279.76s -> 3285.76s]  If you can jump and load up a hand, you kind of need to be able to put
[3285.76s -> 3288.68s]  that load through the hand, which is explosive and dynamic.
[3288.68s -> 3293.36s]  So there's usually like a finger that can take a lot on a model that's straight.
[3293.72s -> 3297.32s]  And because you don't have that, you don't have like a, a finger that's
[3297.32s -> 3299.20s]  punching up in the 30 kilo range.
[3299.52s -> 3305.04s]  Um, that was one thing that made me think, Oh, does this guy like move
[3305.04s -> 3309.28s]  in kind of like a controlled trad style more and like, and you told me a bit
[3309.28s -> 3312.48s]  about like being more of a technician and things, but so the other thing.
[3313.52s -> 3316.32s]  Which was like, interesting was yeah.
[3316.32s -> 3320.28s]  The middle finger in crimp position, but also the fact that when I saw
[3320.32s -> 3326.08s]  combine them across, it made me think that that would be your strongest grip
[3326.08s -> 3330.36s]  would be kind of like open for, because you're getting the most out of the
[3330.36s -> 3334.12s]  fingers in that way in terms of grip applicability, but also finger load.
[3334.72s -> 3341.08s]  And, um, but yeah, like it to me, it's like, it's kind of obvious, like, um,
[3341.56s -> 3344.88s]  you've got to find a way of stimulating that middle finger, especially cause
[3344.88s -> 3345.92s]  that's a low hanging fruit.
[3346.92s -> 3353.20s]  And if you want to kind of get either pinky monos or index monos up, um, I
[3353.20s -> 3356.88s]  mean, I can probably still warm enough to like give you a demonstration
[3356.88s -> 3358.52s]  because we're a similar risk body weight.
[3359.04s -> 3359.36s]  Okay.
[3360.64s -> 3362.16s]  So like, what are you?
[3363.96s -> 3366.32s]  78 or 76.
[3366.80s -> 3367.44s]  78.
[3367.44s -> 3367.60s]  Yeah.
[3367.60s -> 3369.32s]  I'm about 78 kilos.
[3369.32s -> 3371.80s]  So 172 pounds for people listening.
[3371.80s -> 3372.72s]  Something like that right now.
[3372.92s -> 3373.20s]  Yeah.
[3373.56s -> 3375.20s]  I'm like 77.
[3375.76s -> 3376.04s]  Okay.
[3377.24s -> 3381.08s]  But, um, Dan's giving me a demonstration here.
[3381.16s -> 3382.48s]  What do you have set up there?
[3384.40s -> 3385.80s]  Oh, I've just got like a loading pen.
[3386.52s -> 3386.92s]  Okay.
[3387.20s -> 3393.36s]  But I made it out of my fireplace, fireplace poker.
[3394.08s -> 3394.72s]  Oh, that's great.
[3395.80s -> 3396.00s]  Yeah.
[3396.52s -> 3399.08s]  And, um, what have I gone here?
[3399.60s -> 3402.60s]  This is 20, 20 keys.
[3403.48s -> 3406.60s]  And, um, I'll just use that.
[3408.28s -> 3412.60s]  So yeah, this is more like personal training session than podcasters,
[3412.72s -> 3415.60s]  but hopefully people will get the gist.
[3415.80s -> 3416.08s]  Yeah.
[3417.36s -> 3419.20s]  I've got 20 keys on there underneath.
[3419.56s -> 3419.88s]  Okay.
[3420.72s -> 3424.92s]  And, um, if I put that on one part, I'll do it.
[3424.92s -> 3435.48s]  I'm mad at life, but really this like 25, 30, but like I could carry that around
[3435.48s -> 3439.12s]  all day long in the open position.
[3439.92s -> 3446.72s]  Whereas if I go high angle, I mean, that's not going to move really isn't.
[3447.28s -> 3452.12s]  So that just gives you like for that to feel relaxed for me, you know, like
[3452.12s -> 3453.60s]  three to five seconds would be fine.
[3454.12s -> 3460.08s]  And then again, for the index, if I can try and be a bit stricter with where it is,
[3460.96s -> 3470.32s]  but you know, those, those kind of open relaxed loading ones, that is like a
[3470.32s -> 3472.96s]  really useful component in grip to develop.
[3473.28s -> 3479.88s]  And, um, because what you're doing is you're solving a weight issue on the whole.
[3480.36s -> 3488.72s]  And, um, so if, if your pinkie can, let's say loads of people will be up above 20
[3488.72s -> 3494.60s]  in, it depends on body weight, obviously, but if you can hack out 20 to 25 kilos,
[3494.60s -> 3499.52s]  if your body weight, then you've only got to spread the remaining 50 ish, 52
[3500.32s -> 3505.68s]  across the other fingers, which suddenly, and, but because if you put them in a
[3505.68s -> 3509.00s]  half crimp, then that becomes quite tricky.
[3509.24s -> 3513.64s]  And that's why we struggle to one arm dead hang because generally, and this
[3513.64s -> 3516.00s]  is where the middle finger will often.
[3516.52s -> 3517.32s]  Pick up the slack.
[3517.36s -> 3523.76s]  So for myself, um, I'm at like 28 to 30 kilos on the middle.
[3524.40s -> 3528.72s]  And actually my index is kind of a bit crap compared to, so
[3528.72s -> 3530.84s]  like I struggled to get over 15.
[3531.72s -> 3535.12s]  So there's a huge imbalance between my middle finger and my index.
[3535.16s -> 3539.20s]  And that's why in the past few years, I've been slowly targeting my index
[3539.20s -> 3540.88s]  and it has, it has improved.
[3541.20s -> 3548.16s]  And, um, and that's really helped on, but what's, what's interesting is
[3548.16s -> 3551.04s]  actually I kind of was doing that for a little bit and then I've ditched it.
[3551.16s -> 3555.28s]  Then I've gone at a much higher knuckle angles because that translates far
[3555.28s -> 3560.56s]  better to, to rock and what I want to achieve upside and, um, and I've all,
[3560.68s -> 3562.56s]  I've sort of been off a lot of money.
[3563.40s -> 3570.00s]  So like my biological trick is the drag, which like, but that's three
[3570.00s -> 3572.28s]  finger open instead of four finger open.
[3572.80s -> 3578.52s]  So I'm not a huge fan of chisel versus open three.
[3578.52s -> 3582.88s]  If I can use open three, because I think open three versatile, because
[3582.88s -> 3586.24s]  what it allows is the next thing that we haven't discussed, which is
[3586.28s -> 3591.28s]  wrist movement and wrist movement is key to moving.
[3591.52s -> 3595.40s]  It's all very well hanging on a fingerboard or, you know, like
[3596.64s -> 3599.32s]  essentially doing lifts off floor or gym lifts or whatever.
[3599.32s -> 3600.96s]  But this is the problem.
[3600.96s -> 3604.48s]  Whenever you isolate something, you're removing components.
[3604.76s -> 3609.52s]  And if you remove the component and you forget about it, it will come back to
[3609.52s -> 3611.36s]  bite you if it's been a big oversight.
[3611.44s -> 3615.64s]  Now, the oversight with grip is always the next thing in the, in the chain,
[3615.64s -> 3616.44s]  which is the risk.
[3617.24s -> 3619.48s]  And that's where these tests are.
[3620.08s -> 3622.80s]  The be all and end all, because there's this whole interplay
[3622.80s -> 3624.52s]  with all the other body parts.
[3624.68s -> 3630.16s]  Um, the way I break it down, uh, drags of rubbish open three are so
[3630.16s -> 3631.84s]  rubbish in terms of outwards pull.
[3632.16s -> 3636.24s]  You just can't outwards pull with a drag and you, you can't really lock
[3636.24s -> 3637.28s]  below your shoulder with them.
[3637.96s -> 3642.32s]  So you're a bit stuck on rock types, but if you go to font, everything's
[3642.32s -> 3647.76s]  a giant ball or an egg, you know, like barely anything is, um, concave.
[3647.88s -> 3648.92s]  Everything's convex.
[3649.32s -> 3652.52s]  So it's all like bending away from you.
[3652.56s -> 3656.92s]  And that's why the shoulders compression and the elbows explode for people.
[3657.80s -> 3661.72s]  That's like just trying to sum up and stereotype one style of climbing
[3661.72s -> 3663.08s]  that hopefully people understand.
[3663.12s -> 3668.44s]  But obviously each area has its own, you know, like granite isn't just
[3668.44s -> 3672.28s]  granite is it varies worldwide slightly depending on the grain size
[3672.28s -> 3674.32s]  and, and the surface features.
[3674.44s -> 3677.32s]  Some granites really blank and just relies on compression.
[3677.48s -> 3681.64s]  Like your coastal granites tend to be much more grant, um, much blanker.
[3682.24s -> 3685.20s]  And then if you've had a lot of freeze thaw and fracturing, you
[3685.20s -> 3688.00s]  might have a bit more patina, especially in the desert areas.
[3688.00s -> 3692.04s]  Like in USA though, you've got a lot of aridity and dryness.
[3692.04s -> 3694.60s]  Do you get more of that patina shattering, which creates.
[3694.88s -> 3699.36s]  Oh, um, so you get small holds and, um, and then, yeah,
[3699.40s -> 3700.64s]  glaciation, things like that.
[3701.24s -> 3706.20s]  There's so much that forms our rocks and, um, but that all interplays
[3706.20s -> 3707.36s]  with how we can climb up them.
[3707.68s -> 3709.00s]  And the two are directly linked.
[3709.08s -> 3717.80s]  So if you, uh, and, and so the way that feeds back into grip is, um, like
[3717.84s -> 3722.92s]  our style is determined by kind of what, what we want to use, but if you want
[3722.92s -> 3727.72s]  just some like absolute bankers, you know, like that's going to work.
[3727.88s -> 3732.04s]  Then you talk in your half crimp pinky straight three bent,
[3732.16s -> 3733.28s]  because that's really versatile.
[3734.28s -> 3738.44s]  But if you want to talk Trump's that, this is my current thinking.
[3738.80s -> 3743.76s]  And for loads of rock types, especially bouldering, um, then you get the knuckle
[3743.76s -> 3746.56s]  up, you get access to the back of the anchor and suddenly everything's
[3746.56s -> 3747.56s]  like you're climbing on jokes.
[3748.24s -> 3751.96s]  And then however, there's loads of caveats.
[3752.12s -> 3757.84s]  So with your route climbing specializing in a grip, which has a much higher failure.
[3758.52s -> 3763.04s]  Potential such as high angle crimp probably won't do you as many favors as
[3763.60s -> 3768.72s]  getting good at the, um, grips that can take higher loads without failing for
[3768.72s -> 3773.84s]  longer, because often in sport climbing, because you can use the rest of your
[3773.84s -> 3780.12s]  body, uh, to displace load and to flow through the move, then all you're really
[3780.12s -> 3781.96s]  looking for is for your grip not to fail.
[3782.16s -> 3785.88s]  Whereas with bouldering, you might be, you're trying to find like
[3786.20s -> 3791.04s]  the blanket hardest way up thing, or like you're, you're going to your limit a bit
[3791.04s -> 3794.20s]  more, so there is a good chance the grip will fail.
[3794.28s -> 3800.28s]  So if, um, but in, in a power related saying, so I'm just trying to explain
[3800.28s -> 3805.80s]  things through, um, through the hand and finger power rather than, you know,
[3805.92s -> 3809.96s]  it's a bold problem, it's a root type of thing, but, um, how that would reflect
[3809.96s -> 3815.36s]  on your training personally is I would say for your route climbing, the pinky
[3815.36s -> 3817.32s]  being straight is a high priority.
[3817.68s -> 3821.08s]  And, um, it's probably more of a priority than it being bent.
[3821.84s -> 3826.84s]  However, the middle finger being sort of slightly down on load is a priority for
[3826.84s -> 3830.80s]  everything, because to me, that's probably, that's the lowest hanging
[3830.80s -> 3832.68s]  fruit to work on.
[3833.48s -> 3837.88s]  And then the things that you can take away as being like pretty switched
[3837.88s -> 3844.56s]  on right now are actually kind of your pinky and your index, um, performing
[3844.56s -> 3848.48s]  really well in relation to kind of the general levels of benchmarks.
[3848.52s -> 3852.92s]  I would expect it like, you know, for how far down the road you are in terms
[3852.92s -> 3855.32s]  of climbing and niche training.
[3855.60s -> 3858.44s]  And, um, because they said, that's what we're trying to do, isn't it?
[3858.44s -> 3862.60s]  Where we could all just go to the gym and do the three power lift if it was going
[3862.60s -> 3863.00s]  to pay off.
[3865.00s -> 3868.84s]  Really good climbing results, but unfortunately we've got to specialize.
[3869.68s -> 3869.96s]  Okay.
[3869.96s -> 3871.32s]  Let me summarize things again.
[3871.32s -> 3877.12s]  So, uh, for people listening, I did the whole test, the sling test in
[3877.12s -> 3878.52s]  crimp positions with every finger.
[3878.52s -> 3883.44s]  And then I did it again in an open position for each finger, which is a
[3883.44s -> 3885.84s]  little different because of just the physics of it.
[3885.84s -> 3889.04s]  So you have to put the sling further up on your finger, basically turning it
[3889.04s -> 3891.88s]  into like a one pad hold instead of a fingertip hold.
[3892.36s -> 3894.60s]  So of course the loads are going to go up just from that.
[3894.60s -> 3896.76s]  But then also I'm, I think I'm stronger open hand.
[3897.40s -> 3899.84s]  Um, so yeah, I want to reiterate some things and make sure I'm
[3899.84s -> 3900.76s]  getting everything right.
[3900.76s -> 3907.52s]  So my, my pinkies in a crimp position, I was able to lift about nine kilos and
[3907.52s -> 3911.24s]  then open hand pinky about 16 kilos.
[3911.28s -> 3915.12s]  And so you're saying one of the standouts for you is that my open hand
[3915.12s -> 3917.64s]  pinky should be closer to 20 kilos.
[3918.24s -> 3918.76s]  Is that right?
[3918.76s -> 3919.00s]  Yeah.
[3919.00s -> 3920.16s]  Like at least.
[3920.20s -> 3923.92s]  At least I would have expected it to have jumped up quite a lot.
[3924.24s -> 3929.56s]  And the fact that those two are quite close, like without, if I didn't know
[3929.56s -> 3933.20s]  you and I was just looking at the data at all, and you know, just, just the
[3933.20s -> 3937.40s]  data and I had to try and invent a climber, I'd be like, well, they
[3937.40s -> 3943.44s]  obviously, um, favor, uh, pulling through with the pinky bent quite a
[3943.44s -> 3948.40s]  lot on small holds because it's just not taking the load on, on bigger ones.
[3948.44s -> 3954.08s]  But that also mean, um, like, but then when I looked at the index,
[3954.08s -> 3956.96s]  that your index was actually like pretty good.
[3956.96s -> 3960.88s]  Like it's not, it's, it's just like doing well.
[3961.20s -> 3964.44s]  And, uh, and then I was like, oh, well actually, if you add that into
[3964.44s -> 3968.92s]  chisel that, um, that works pretty well.
[3969.36s -> 3973.92s]  So that I I'm sort of inventing this climate that does like, you know,
[3973.92s -> 3978.88s]  lots of climbing like that and, and then at high angle, but then maybe.
[3979.80s -> 3984.12s]  Like, this is almost totally missing from being like a real strength.
[3985.04s -> 3985.24s]  Yeah.
[3985.24s -> 3988.04s]  I'm going to, I'm going to jump in just because people, not everyone's
[3988.04s -> 3989.52s]  going to be able to see the video here.
[3989.52s -> 3990.96s]  So, yeah, no worries.
[3990.96s -> 3994.48s]  So, um, Dan was saying that he was imagining just from looking at my
[3994.48s -> 3999.36s]  numbers that I would likely climb a lot in a chisel position, which is like an
[3999.36s -> 4003.84s]  open four and in a small crimp or like full crimp position, and then what was
[4003.84s -> 4008.76s]  missing would be the half crimp, like the in-between you're spot on.
[4008.80s -> 4011.32s]  You're exactly, you're exactly, exactly right.
[4011.44s -> 4011.84s]  Yeah.
[4011.92s -> 4014.92s]  Um, those are, that is how I climb.
[4014.92s -> 4016.48s]  That's how I've kind of always climbed.
[4017.28s -> 4018.96s]  Half crimp has always been a struggle.
[4018.96s -> 4021.72s]  I've been training it honestly too, for a long time now.
[4021.72s -> 4026.68s]  And it just, it just seems to be a really, really slow, um, aggravating
[4026.68s -> 4028.36s]  journey to improve my half crimp.
[4028.80s -> 4032.12s]  Um, this might be a little bit of a tangent, but I wanted to ask you this.
[4032.28s -> 4038.12s]  One thing I've noticed with the half crimp for me is that my pinky feels
[4038.12s -> 4042.68s]  like the length of my pinky, I think is an interesting thing to think about.
[4042.68s -> 4045.92s]  So if I'm in a half crimp in my index, middle and ring fingers are all
[4045.92s -> 4048.36s]  bent at a 90 at the, uh, pip joint.
[4049.12s -> 4053.60s]  My pinky almost feels like it's in between, like it's not, it's a little
[4053.60s -> 4056.64s]  bit too long to really be hanging open, but it's not long enough
[4056.64s -> 4058.72s]  to be also able to crimp up.
[4058.72s -> 4062.52s]  So it feels like it's kind of stuck in this no man's land where it just
[4062.52s -> 4063.96s]  can't really contribute very much.
[4063.96s -> 4068.16s]  And I wonder if that's a big part of why it's weak, because it's not able
[4068.16s -> 4069.64s]  to pull that much when I'm training it.
[4069.64s -> 4072.20s]  And also why my, my half crimp feels so difficult.
[4073.12s -> 4075.28s]  What sort of pressure do you put through your pinky?
[4075.28s -> 4079.68s]  So if you were to just visualize your pinky when you're hanging, um, are you
[4079.68s -> 4084.24s]  trying to squish with the end of it when it is open and does like, or does
[4084.24s -> 4089.32s]  your knuckle kick in, in the bend or do you, and are you like relaxing
[4089.48s -> 4090.68s]  in the way that it's hanging?
[4090.96s -> 4094.60s]  So this is the whole passive and active thing, but just go into more
[4094.60s -> 4100.68s]  nerdery, how does that play out in your pinky in terms of like, cause say,
[4100.68s -> 4104.52s]  if you, if I try and pick that weight up there now with 20 kilos and I try
[4104.52s -> 4107.92s]  and sort of like squish it with my fingertip, I won't be able to lift it.
[4108.88s -> 4113.92s]  But if I, if I have it nicely nestled on the joint and I sort of almost
[4113.92s -> 4119.72s]  relax a bit and I lift it more with connective tissue and, um, sort of
[4119.72s -> 4123.76s]  pulley stickage, then that can lift a much higher load.
[4124.20s -> 4129.44s]  So I'm just wondering if in your head, whether those kind of like the activation
[4129.44s -> 4133.48s]  pathways of how you're trying to activate the grip, maybe there's
[4133.48s -> 4135.28s]  something in that that's worth discussing.
[4135.72s -> 4136.48s]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[4136.48s -> 4137.68s]  There might be something there.
[4137.68s -> 4141.40s]  I think I'll, I'll pay attention to that next time I'm hanging on the
[4141.44s -> 4141.80s]  board.
[4141.80s -> 4145.96s]  What I think I'm doing is I think I'm trying to use it like a sky hook, you
[4145.96s -> 4150.04s]  know, just hang it, just skin hanging on the edge of the hold, but it feels like
[4150.04s -> 4154.04s]  it's slightly too long to do that naturally.
[4154.08s -> 4157.48s]  If my other fingers are in a half current position, if that makes sense, you know.
[4158.68s -> 4158.84s]  Yeah.
[4158.84s -> 4159.68s]  And does it slip?
[4161.36s -> 4162.00s]  Good question.
[4162.00s -> 4162.64s]  Does it move?
[4163.12s -> 4164.12s]  Uh, yeah, I'm not sure.
[4164.16s -> 4166.24s]  I'll think about that next time I'm training.
[4167.04s -> 4173.76s]  If it's not moving, um, you probably have enough, uh, pit like, uh, FTP
[4173.76s -> 4176.84s]  pressure in it to maintain the grip.
[4176.88s -> 4183.04s]  So there's, there's a good way of, um, anchoring it, but if it is slipping,
[4183.20s -> 4185.56s]  then you're not getting the tip pressure in the FTP.
[4186.20s -> 4191.40s]  And you might be say activated through your finger and connection
[4191.44s -> 4192.96s]  rather than your crimp connection.
[4193.68s -> 4199.36s]  And for me with the lack of activation, say on your pinky lift, there's
[4199.36s -> 4205.96s]  something there that maybe says, um, I mean, sort of regardless of, of, of
[4205.96s -> 4209.64s]  what's gone before, I think you can tackle it or these things are always
[4209.64s -> 4213.64s]  tackleable just by finding a good way to isolate them.
[4213.88s -> 4216.52s]  And I don't necessarily think that's finger lifting off the floor.
[4217.16s -> 4224.88s]  Um, what I think, uh, you almost need to find, this is what I've always done.
[4224.88s -> 4230.76s]  This is why the, the beast maker, like we have the progression, like I never
[4230.76s -> 4235.96s]  wanted people to, um, to train pockets because you should just train pockets.
[4236.76s -> 4239.72s]  Like they're not important for most of the climbing, but they're really
[4239.72s -> 4242.32s]  important for activating your hand properly.
[4243.24s -> 4245.72s]  So back to you is like this key.
[4245.76s -> 4249.04s]  When you get onto bird beaks, I'm back to people find back to horrible.
[4249.80s -> 4254.72s]  But then when you, once you get down onto like one pad pockets, you start to bird
[4254.72s -> 4259.88s]  beak and once you can, which is when the pinkies straight and the ring fingers
[4259.88s -> 4265.12s]  bent and once you're on back to you with that, with that grip formed, um, that
[4265.12s -> 4267.12s]  translates so well into half crimp.
[4267.68s -> 4270.00s]  But what you're doing is you're removing the.
[4270.56s -> 4275.92s]  The blunderbuss of stimulating the middle and the impacts, and you're just targeting
[4275.92s -> 4278.92s]  that feeling of how to form the back of the half crimp.
[4279.64s -> 4283.60s]  So, and this is what I've always thought was a good method of
[4283.60s -> 4285.52s]  training, uh, and I could be wrong.
[4286.44s -> 4291.04s]  It does frustrate me a little bit that I think a lot of in recent years, people
[4291.04s -> 4296.72s]  have, uh, pushed fingerboards that are easier to make in a Play-Doh mold spindle
[4296.72s -> 4300.80s]  molded style, but that you do away with all the vagaries, which is great.
[4300.80s -> 4302.96s]  Cause you can just say, oh yeah, just among an edge.
[4303.92s -> 4307.00s]  But actually what you're doing is you're removing your ability
[4307.00s -> 4309.36s]  to visually see insight easily.
[4309.60s -> 4315.20s]  And for me, I would stress that insight is a key part of breaking
[4315.20s -> 4320.12s]  apart your grips in order to reform it in a way that can, you can build off quicker.
[4320.72s -> 4326.92s]  Um, and so that's why I mean, to keep it on sort of fingerboard training chat.
[4327.36s -> 4329.88s]  Uh, that's why the beast maker looks like it does.
[4330.36s -> 4335.84s]  We know we like, it could have just had a bunch of edges on, um, but the whole
[4335.92s -> 4340.56s]  point of principle is like, find out where your grip is, we break it apart,
[4340.60s -> 4345.88s]  then put it back together, um, rather than just like load the sucker up
[4345.88s -> 4351.64s]  and then see when it fails, because like it, it, for me, it works.
[4351.80s -> 4356.12s]  And like, I know for Ned it's work for, and this is the problem.
[4356.12s -> 4357.72s]  Like I'm not a sociable person.
[4357.80s -> 4362.16s]  I've just got a couple of mates that we muck around with this thing with, uh,
[4362.64s -> 4365.88s]  but like I'd back it, I'd back this horse all the way.
[4366.08s -> 4370.76s]  Like if someone, if someone says like, oh yeah, just like, I'm all right.
[4371.24s -> 4372.40s]  Open falls away to go.
[4373.08s -> 4375.44s]  I do one arm dead hangs with an extra 30 kilos.
[4375.44s -> 4376.32s]  It's like, oh, well done.
[4376.80s -> 4381.32s]  I can do one arm tracks with an extra 30 kilos on a less than 20 mil edge.
[4381.40s -> 4384.28s]  It really doesn't help me get up Aiden's problems in the lakes.
[4385.88s -> 4386.16s]  Wow.
[4386.16s -> 4387.80s]  That's so insanely strong though.
[4387.96s -> 4388.84s]  That's crazy.
[4389.32s -> 4393.00s]  It couldn't be a shitter grip in the, you know, like it, it doesn't apply.
[4393.36s -> 4395.00s]  It does apply on sandstone and on grip.
[4395.36s -> 4401.96s]  And I can really like make it make it pay that, but for little edges, it's,
[4402.08s -> 4403.64s]  it's junk, it's total junk.
[4403.88s -> 4406.00s]  Like, um, I may as well not have it.
[4406.60s -> 4412.12s]  So, um, and, and that's where like, there are tricks in training and there are
[4412.12s -> 4417.44s]  things that make you look strong, but actually getting to the applicability
[4417.44s -> 4423.96s]  and the, um, like for me, it's, it's, it's like, it's constantly something
[4423.96s -> 4427.64s]  you have to work on because also there's so many pitfalls neurologically
[4427.64s -> 4431.84s]  just falling back into your normal, you know, everybody wants to climb
[4431.84s -> 4433.64s]  in a certain way, we're all built a certain way.
[4433.72s -> 4438.92s]  So this is a fight, you know, for me, bench pressing, my body weight is a fight.
[4439.28s -> 4441.00s]  I've neglected it my entire life.
[4441.24s -> 4442.28s]  It's not something I'm good at.
[4442.76s -> 4444.32s]  Uh, I've never bothered with it.
[4444.48s -> 4448.56s]  Luckily, I don't feel like I need it for climbing, but I need it for balance.
[4448.64s -> 4451.28s]  And I think it will really help me if they get that up now.
[4451.56s -> 4456.92s]  And, um, but you know, these are my problems that I need to work on, but
[4456.92s -> 4460.56s]  everybody's got their own personal things, but what's interesting is like,
[4461.44s -> 4467.04s]  so in terms of finger advice, like I'm, I feel like I'm, I know what I'm working
[4467.04s -> 4471.80s]  on and I'm happy, but in terms of like athletic advice and being an athlete,
[4471.84s -> 4475.20s]  I'm awful in terms of diet, I'm awful.
[4475.36s -> 4479.20s]  I paid, like, I just eat what is in front of me, pay no attention.
[4479.72s -> 4483.40s]  Um, in terms of reading conditions and weather, I think I'm pretty
[4483.40s -> 4485.16s]  good at making up myself on that.
[4485.52s -> 4486.60s]  I did a geography degree.
[4486.76s -> 4487.72s]  I've never needed a fire.
[4488.72s -> 4491.60s]  So you've never, what needed a fan?
[4494.80s -> 4495.28s]  Nice.
[4496.68s -> 4496.92s]  Yeah.
[4496.92s -> 4503.04s]  So, um, I've digressed a bit, but, um, what I'm saying is, uh, hopefully
[4503.60s -> 4506.96s]  with these insights, you can begin to know it all.
[4507.04s -> 4509.52s]  There's loads of other things at play in like your wrist strength
[4509.64s -> 4512.08s]  and how you pull through the hold.
[4512.80s -> 4516.88s]  So actually I think you're pretty well set on small holds in terms
[4517.08s -> 4520.68s]  of for the time being, almost in that handle position,
[4520.80s -> 4522.76s]  except for the middle finger.
[4523.16s -> 4528.20s]  Um, so if I was going to try and quickly distill down how you
[4528.20s -> 4534.48s]  would work on that directly, I would say for your pinky target the back
[4534.52s -> 4537.64s]  to in a way that simulates half crimp.
[4538.56s -> 4542.96s]  You might want to go straight to bird beak to just avoid vagaries, but take
[4543.00s -> 4547.88s]  weight off until you're at like 60 to 70% body weight, which is in a, a
[4547.88s -> 4553.16s]  non-threatening grip load, and then just develop that base level with those
[4553.16s -> 4557.36s]  density hangs that, you know, like you've got a really good hang routine.
[4557.48s -> 4560.48s]  So I would just like be adding that in.
[4561.36s -> 4568.96s]  And then for the middle finger, it's trickier in some ways, because I would
[4568.96s -> 4575.52s]  say, yeah, I mean, just the natural split is if you were going to target that,
[4576.24s -> 4581.20s]  you probably just want to get a good angle with front two and again, back
[4581.20s -> 4586.08s]  it off to a level that's like 60 to 70% body weight to out.
[4586.56s -> 4592.32s]  And then the main thing is to memorize what the grip feels like when you're
[4592.32s -> 4596.48s]  failing on it on a moonboard problem or on the steep board or something like that.
[4596.84s -> 4598.20s]  Just capture that in your head.
[4599.20s -> 4604.64s]  Pull it back to the fingerboard and find that element of the grip position, but
[4604.96s -> 4610.56s]  splitting the fingers, getting rid of the fluff, and then hammer that until it
[4610.56s -> 4614.60s]  starts to kick in and when it starts to kick in, put it back together.
[4614.76s -> 4618.84s]  And if it feels like it's working, which it should, you will have got stronger.
[4619.00s -> 4624.44s]  And then you can just repeat, you know, until, until you need like the next
[4624.44s -> 4630.48s]  level of kind of nerdery to, um, to sort of, and then obviously like you don't
[4630.48s -> 4635.76s]  need to go too far down these rabbit holes in terms of, for me, like that
[4635.76s -> 4639.72s]  would be enough because climbing so multifactorial, you know, it's
[4639.72s -> 4640.88s]  probably not the whole picture.
[4641.00s -> 4647.68s]  It's just part of the picture, but I do think, um, For you personally,
[4647.72s -> 4651.80s]  try and find a way of stimulating that middle finger in position and the
[4651.80s -> 4652.96s]  pinky in the straight position.
[4653.08s -> 4656.72s]  And then they will be the areas of, of the big payoff.
[4657.28s -> 4662.08s]  What's interesting about just comparing to myself is for me, the
[4662.08s -> 4667.72s]  battle is with my index being bent and in half crimp, I've had good progress
[4667.72s -> 4671.96s]  on my pinky now in bent position, but actually I haven't really paid much
[4671.96s -> 4677.36s]  attention to my index pretty strong on the drag and when it's open.
[4677.60s -> 4682.48s]  And I think that's also a problem in that as my grip fails, you know, it
[4682.48s -> 4686.48s]  falls into almost a stronger position, but I'm not getting out of the hold
[4686.48s -> 4689.64s]  what I need to, because I'm not accessing the cuts and things.
[4690.28s -> 4697.52s]  Um, but, and so my fight a minute with my training time is high angle
[4697.52s -> 4703.52s]  crimps and specifically targeting that the outside of my hand puddle, which
[4703.56s -> 4709.40s]  is like my index and my pinky because my middle fingers, and I'm lucky in
[4709.40s -> 4711.16s]  that I'm similar to aim like this.
[4711.16s -> 4714.32s]  So it almost makes it easier to emulate this training and stuff.
[4714.32s -> 4719.20s]  And the way we've trained, um, we're both kind of like middle to dominant
[4719.20s -> 4724.08s]  crimpers, um, but you do see a real mix of where people put the power through
[4724.08s -> 4729.40s]  actually, and, um, I've met climbers over the years, like, um, Ed Hamer,
[4729.40s -> 4733.24s]  who was ridiculously strong with his back to, um, I've met.
[4733.56s -> 4737.60s]  Good English climbers, like Jeff Caffey, who's ridiculously strong with
[4737.60s -> 4740.00s]  this front tooth and as a good climbers.
[4740.04s -> 4742.88s]  And it, it isn't just the case that we're all the same, you know?
[4742.88s -> 4744.76s]  So that's, that's what I find interesting.
[4745.04s -> 4749.28s]  Um, but what I should have done probably is like build up a database,
[4751.00s -> 4753.96s]  you know, like a bit, a bit more scientific about it.
[4753.96s -> 4759.08s]  But, um, unfortunately I haven't done that because I'm a human.
[4761.08s -> 4762.28s]  Man, this is fascinating.
[4762.28s -> 4763.72s]  So thank, thank you for all that.
[4763.72s -> 4768.60s]  First off for the, um, for the recommendations, cause that's of course
[4768.64s -> 4772.24s]  what I was most excited about getting out of this conversation and it's
[4772.24s -> 4775.96s]  fascinating, but I have a question there, so that's, it's really surprising
[4775.96s -> 4779.92s]  actually, and interesting to me that you said that you wouldn't, that you
[4779.92s -> 4784.20s]  don't think lifting something off the floor is the best way to take care of
[4784.20s -> 4788.00s]  that, um, cause intuitively to me, I got these results and I was like, okay,
[4788.64s -> 4790.20s]  I'm going to use the tension block.
[4790.24s -> 4792.80s]  I'm going to isolate all my fingers as monos.
[4793.28s -> 4797.08s]  I'm going to lift weight off the floor with my pinky mono and
[4797.08s -> 4798.52s]  start training it that way.
[4799.00s -> 4801.64s]  And then I was just thinking as you were talking like, oh, I could do the
[4801.64s -> 4805.40s]  same thing with my middle finger, but basically like half crimping
[4805.44s -> 4807.08s]  a mono with the block.
[4807.92s -> 4808.92s]  Why not do that?
[4808.92s -> 4813.60s]  Why do you think it is that, or why do you recommend that I stand beneath
[4813.60s -> 4818.64s]  the hang board and keep my feet on the ground and pull in these front to
[4818.64s -> 4822.56s]  back to crimp positions rather than isolating fingers on their own?
[4823.56s -> 4823.72s]  Yeah.
[4823.72s -> 4828.04s]  Like well picked up on, uh, blunderbuss and rifle.
[4828.32s -> 4834.00s]  So if you lift off the floor, your wrist angle will not replicate climbing.
[4834.36s -> 4835.92s]  It'll be a straight wrist angle.
[4836.48s -> 4839.64s]  Um, just like if you lift pinch blocks off the floor, your wrist
[4839.64s -> 4842.64s]  is massively, um, on the extensors.
[4843.16s -> 4847.44s]  And yet when you climb, unless you're doing like pinch two for stuff in front
[4847.48s -> 4851.60s]  of you, or you're doing a pinch cross through, you never hit your extensors
[4851.60s -> 4852.76s]  on a pinch when you're climbing.
[4852.84s -> 4857.20s]  When you're on a board, you're deviated and your wrist pretty flat and
[4857.20s -> 4859.00s]  you might get a bit of extensive work.
[4859.76s -> 4864.48s]  So like the, there are oversights that are built into lifting off the floor,
[4864.56s -> 4869.32s]  which, um, every, every reductive form of training has drawbacks, like
[4869.32s -> 4871.04s]  finger body has drawbacks as well.
[4871.04s -> 4873.28s]  And, but what I don't like about.
[4874.16s -> 4877.84s]  Sort of training hard with splitting those fingers up.
[4878.64s -> 4879.52s]  There's two things.
[4880.04s -> 4882.16s]  Your sessions in the week will be quite impacted.
[4882.16s -> 4887.24s]  If you just do like, if you do the off the floor lifts, it'll definitely work.
[4887.48s -> 4893.72s]  Um, what I'm trying to do in terms of advice is more up-to-date thinking
[4894.20s -> 4898.60s]  of how I think nowadays, which is, um, if you can keep all the applicability
[4898.60s -> 4903.44s]  in there and build in the exact grip position that you need, but stimulate
[4903.44s -> 4906.40s]  the area, but still have as much.
[4907.40s -> 4912.44s]  Uh, it'd be as reductive as possible to kind of target that, but still
[4912.44s -> 4917.16s]  have enough elements of climbing that it feeds back, um, like
[4917.16s -> 4918.44s]  it'll slot straight back in.
[4919.24s -> 4922.12s]  Not with a lot of off the floor lifts and things like that.
[4922.16s -> 4923.64s]  Is that great for target load?
[4923.64s -> 4927.40s]  Like they do a really good job of isolating and hitting what you need,
[4927.44s -> 4931.36s]  especially if you're injured, it's fantastic because you can get rid of the
[4931.36s -> 4935.32s]  parts that hurt if you've got shoulder injury and, you know, this can be way
[4935.32s -> 4938.32s]  better pulling off the floor probably because you've likely injured it
[4938.32s -> 4939.20s]  with your arm above your head.
[4939.68s -> 4945.00s]  And, um, so yeah, basically keeping it as applicable as possible while
[4945.00s -> 4950.08s]  stimulating as little of your body as possible in terms of extraneous
[4950.08s -> 4954.92s]  variables and fluff, but also stimulating as much of your body as possible.
[4954.96s -> 4959.84s]  So just translating those neurological pathways and the way you fire straight
[4959.84s -> 4965.80s]  back into your climbing, because this is the issue I have with some gym
[4965.80s -> 4970.08s]  lifts and stuff like that is we would be, we would see more people coming
[4970.08s -> 4975.64s]  into climbing and just smashing out of the park with the kind of gym strength
[4975.64s -> 4980.84s]  you get if, if the firing and the pathways were as directly applicable.
[4981.00s -> 4987.56s]  And, um, and I like to, with all my high angle crimp training that I've been
[4987.56s -> 4994.48s]  doing, if I just hang off my fingers, I really don't like the way I can't dig
[4994.48s -> 4997.56s]  in the back of the holes because you're hanging directly below them.
[4997.88s -> 5001.84s]  So what I do is I chuck my feet forwards and I step on a tiny little edge.
[5002.40s -> 5006.88s]  So it's almost like I'm just sort of doing dead hangs on the board, but
[5006.88s -> 5010.64s]  that means I can pull out and I can activate my rear deltoid.
[5011.24s -> 5016.96s]  So trying to emulate Aiden again, and then, um, but what that does is it
[5016.96s -> 5021.24s]  create, I get the income, I get the, I get the output and then I get the
[5021.24s -> 5023.08s]  stimulation in the pathway that I need.
[5023.16s -> 5025.52s]  Otherwise I'll just fire onto my laps.
[5026.00s -> 5030.52s]  And I, if I, because my drag and stuff and my non failing grip
[5030.52s -> 5032.40s]  types can just rip through my laps.
[5032.44s -> 5034.64s]  I've always been quite a dynamic, flicky climber.
[5035.28s -> 5037.12s]  I've not been great at static climbing.
[5037.16s -> 5041.16s]  So I'm having to like shunt and bludgeon this form of climbing back
[5041.16s -> 5044.00s]  into, uh, back into me at age 35.
[5044.20s -> 5047.80s]  And it's, it's kind of working in some ways, but I just don't
[5047.80s -> 5049.36s]  have the time now for it to.
[5049.36s -> 5053.76s]  Um, I think I would love to do this experiment in my twenties and see,
[5054.96s -> 5057.44s]  just get out on rock a bit more and, you know, just cross
[5057.44s -> 5059.64s]  compare how much it works.
[5060.28s -> 5063.60s]  But what I keep doing is get really inspired by sandstone projects.
[5064.48s -> 5067.48s]  Go with, you know, in all my spare time, I'd go off to the wilderness
[5067.48s -> 5070.88s]  and when no one cares about in England, try all these hard boulders.
[5071.76s -> 5072.76s]  Um, on sandstone.
[5072.76s -> 5075.68s]  And then I come home and train all this like high angle crimp
[5076.12s -> 5078.12s]  shoulders style and don't use any of it.
[5078.48s -> 5082.76s]  So what I wanted to do was to actually get in the lakes this year and start
[5082.76s -> 5084.52s]  to put it down and get on the projects.
[5084.52s -> 5087.68s]  I failed on the past, but I've had this really annoying arm injury that
[5088.40s -> 5093.56s]  has, uh, mostly stopped that this year to just like a bit of a neck
[5093.68s -> 5095.56s]  brachioradialis nerve thing.
[5095.56s -> 5096.92s]  That's been really hard to pin down.
[5097.20s -> 5099.44s]  And, um, but I'm finally getting there with it.
[5099.64s -> 5105.84s]  Uh, basically I just too much DIY and kid carrying and yeah, the
[5105.84s -> 5107.48s]  general life would break you down.
[5109.96s -> 5112.00s]  Uh, but yeah, that's why basically, sorry.
[5114.60s -> 5115.56s]  No, this is all great.
[5115.56s -> 5115.84s]  Okay.
[5115.84s -> 5117.92s]  So I'm going to, I'm just going to repeat it back to you though.
[5117.92s -> 5122.20s]  So the reason I would do this on a hangboard instead of lifting off the
[5122.20s -> 5126.64s]  floor is because it's still targeted and very specific to the things
[5126.64s -> 5128.68s]  I'm, I'm focusing on on my fingers.
[5128.68s -> 5130.92s]  It's reductive in that way, but it.
[5131.40s -> 5135.04s]  It maintains some of the more applicability to climbing
[5135.76s -> 5137.44s]  than lifting off the floor would.
[5137.44s -> 5139.56s]  It's just like, you know, the wrist angle is a little bit more
[5139.56s -> 5140.68s]  relevant and things like that.
[5142.00s -> 5144.84s]  Yeah, the wrist and then how it feeds in each shoulders and your arms.
[5144.92s -> 5149.64s]  But what I would say is if you feel more comfortable, if you, whichever
[5149.64s -> 5154.80s]  way you can, you can bottle that feeling, you need to like take a
[5154.80s -> 5161.16s]  picture, a sort of feeling picture of the grip, and then you need to copy
[5161.16s -> 5163.40s]  and paste that back into your training.
[5163.48s -> 5167.68s]  But with, with it split out the, you know, taking out the part you need,
[5167.80s -> 5172.36s]  which for you, I would say would be like back to bird beak, which is, or
[5172.36s -> 5175.20s]  like, um, front to crimp like that.
[5175.72s -> 5177.88s]  And now the, the weights you're going to be training on with
[5177.88s -> 5179.08s]  those are going to be really low.
[5179.40s -> 5184.12s]  So it might be better to do it on the floor and lifting off the floor.
[5184.12s -> 5188.12s]  If you don't have a good police at home or wherever you train to take
[5188.12s -> 5190.92s]  the weight off on the fingerboard, because that is going to give you
[5190.92s -> 5195.76s]  better results, but if you do, what I'm saying is please do it on the
[5195.76s -> 5200.48s]  fingerboard because it has more applicability and shapes that you're
[5200.48s -> 5205.08s]  making with your back and your arms, um, for climbing now, the difference
[5205.08s -> 5208.96s]  is if you want to get really clever and periodize training and things
[5210.12s -> 5212.28s]  do that off the floor lift.
[5212.28s -> 5216.64s]  If you're going to hit another element of your training on a different day.
[5217.08s -> 5221.40s]  So it's the whole, you know, train what's fresh, um, principle.
[5222.36s -> 5228.16s]  And, and, but that to me is like an extra level of like real training
[5228.64s -> 5232.88s]  which I think most climbers will struggle to nail that.
[5233.40s -> 5236.48s]  I mean that most people just want to get on a, you know, they
[5236.48s -> 5237.80s]  haven't got that much time.
[5238.16s -> 5243.76s]  Um, it's best to just keep it at the level of keep it applicable because I
[5243.76s -> 5246.72s]  think you get into dangerous territory if you go to reductive.
[5246.76s -> 5249.20s]  So I think you could get, say really good at climbing with
[5249.20s -> 5250.76s]  like a load of gym exercises.
[5251.56s -> 5255.36s]  And if you split the days apart and you've got like that perfect training
[5255.36s -> 5259.80s]  cycle, you could hit all the muscles well and get all that extra gain in
[5259.80s -> 5263.64s]  terms of just everything getting to recover properly and you're not having
[5263.64s -> 5267.68s]  that crossover, which we've climbing were awful at the crossover, especially
[5267.68s -> 5271.00s]  on the fingers, like we just hit the fingers all the time in the week.
[5272.88s -> 5275.52s]  Like, Oh, I'll do roots and I'll do bouldering and out.
[5275.56s -> 5277.32s]  You could just like, you're on your fingers the whole week.
[5277.44s -> 5278.64s]  No one in strongman does that.
[5278.72s -> 5282.52s]  They don't like hit their abs or their core, you know, but they're
[5282.52s -> 5286.28s]  lucky enough that they, but the sport is able to be reduced easily.
[5286.36s -> 5289.72s]  Ours is team movement complex to do it.
[5289.80s -> 5296.12s]  But if you were talking like, um, yeah, so you, you can periodize like that,
[5296.12s -> 5299.16s]  but I think that's why you need good coaching and stuff.
[5299.24s -> 5304.12s]  And for me, yeah, you, you would just like, you'd really have to take some
[5304.12s -> 5307.56s]  time and write and break that apart in the week, which you could do like,
[5308.48s -> 5310.32s]  um, yourself or who you work with.
[5310.32s -> 5313.72s]  And that's where I would do the off the floor lift to deliberately separate
[5313.72s -> 5315.60s]  it and try and not get that crossover.
[5316.40s -> 5319.84s]  So again, this is what we're on about that whole thing.
[5320.36s -> 5323.52s]  Uh, hold that whole point that like, nobody's got the right answer and you
[5323.52s -> 5325.56s]  can just experiment with what works.
[5325.96s -> 5332.40s]  Um, but hopefully what I've tried to add is I would back that these
[5332.40s -> 5333.84s]  are good things for you to work on.
[5334.84s -> 5339.76s]  If you can encapsulate that feeling of why it's failing and
[5340.00s -> 5343.08s]  transplant that onto the fingerboard and just incorporate it into your
[5343.08s -> 5345.76s]  fingerboard workout at a basic level.
[5345.76s -> 5349.88s]  I think that will hopefully like help your climbing.
[5350.12s -> 5355.04s]  Um, it's just like, um, and then you can try and make it more
[5355.04s -> 5357.04s]  complex if it does work, you know, period.
[5358.28s -> 5361.48s]  But to begin with, and especially for most people that might be listening,
[5362.16s -> 5365.40s]  um, I think that's the, that's the best way of doing it.
[5365.44s -> 5367.16s]  If that's kind of what I used to do.
[5367.16s -> 5372.68s]  And I know it kind of works with, um, uh, so I always, I kind of got to know
[5372.68s -> 5376.96s]  how my index was weak because I could do like back three, one arm that hangs
[5376.96s -> 5381.84s]  fine on the 20 mil edge, but front three was like this pipe dream.
[5382.16s -> 5386.68s]  And then it's so funny when I was like, let the gym could do front three half
[5386.68s -> 5387.60s]  crimp when I'm dead hands.
[5387.60s -> 5391.04s]  Cause I thought this was like some awesome, amazing.
[5391.64s -> 5395.96s]  Well, it is for me, like, it's just incredible to, I don't think that
[5395.96s -> 5399.80s]  strength of me would be hard to work on.
[5399.84s -> 5401.04s]  It would take me a long time.
[5401.16s -> 5404.00s]  I would, you know, and that's what people should think about this as well.
[5404.00s -> 5405.88s]  Like this isn't a goal for four weeks.
[5405.92s -> 5407.44s]  This is a goal for like two years.
[5409.76s -> 5415.68s]  You're not going to up your finger by 10 kilos of pull in like four weeks of
[5415.68s -> 5422.28s]  training, but what I will say, you could get two or three kilos pretty quick.
[5422.72s -> 5423.12s]  Okay.
[5424.00s -> 5424.88s]  Well, let me ask you this.
[5424.88s -> 5429.32s]  I mean, do you have any recommendations for me as far as the actual protocol
[5429.36s -> 5433.00s]  goes, you know, if I'm going to have a session where I focus on bird beak on
[5433.00s -> 5438.16s]  the back two and then the front two in a crimp, um, edge size, you know,
[5438.16s -> 5443.00s]  should I do this on pockets or should I just do the two fingers on a flat edge?
[5443.04s -> 5444.48s]  Does edge size matter?
[5445.48s -> 5448.52s]  Any thoughts on training style protocols?
[5448.52s -> 5448.88s]  Yeah.
[5449.88s -> 5456.08s]  Um, so basically to keep it quite simple, slot it into the peak of the session.
[5457.00s -> 5461.64s]  So your warmup and you, you know, your, your middle and end
[5461.64s -> 5463.48s]  third, just keep exactly the same.
[5463.84s -> 5468.60s]  So likely to be, you know, pyramiding up four finger dead
[5468.60s -> 5472.48s]  hangs and stuff like that in the fresh part of your session.
[5473.12s -> 5477.44s]  So I would split that apart as being like, um, front burner and back burner.
[5477.68s -> 5480.24s]  If you wanted to just stick them on the back burner, shove them in
[5480.24s -> 5482.40s]  at the end of the session, but make sure you're still fresh.
[5483.16s -> 5486.56s]  But if you want to make this a priority and target it, put it in the middle
[5486.56s -> 5491.64s]  of the pyramid, in the middle of the session, and I would say, keep it on
[5491.64s -> 5494.04s]  an edge size, which you're going to be hitting on the routes that you're
[5494.04s -> 5497.52s]  failing on and on the board problems that you're failing on.
[5497.56s -> 5501.28s]  So that's likely to be 20 mil or less.
[5501.72s -> 5505.32s]  And what you want to do is just take the weight off until it works.
[5505.68s -> 5509.52s]  If you're going to be doing it on the fingerboard or put the weight on until
[5509.52s -> 5512.36s]  you get to the right level of stimulation, if you're lifting off the ground.
[5513.52s -> 5517.16s]  And the key thing is just making sure that that feeling is the same.
[5517.32s -> 5519.28s]  So if it's on a pocket, that's fine.
[5520.52s -> 5525.56s]  Like it, it, it might benefit you more like your pinkies like
[5525.56s -> 5527.68s]  sneaky and likes to roll out sideways.
[5527.96s -> 5529.32s]  The pockets can stop that.
[5529.52s -> 5533.36s]  And that's why pockets are just nicer to train on per pockets because
[5533.36s -> 5535.32s]  they stop your fingers rolling laterally.
[5535.92s -> 5542.80s]  Um, but the, you might want to do it on an edge, just if it's more convenient.
[5542.84s -> 5546.60s]  And, um, it's again, it's just what, just focus on that feeling
[5546.96s -> 5548.96s]  and trying to copy and paste it.
[5549.68s -> 5553.56s]  And then in terms of the level, there's two things you need to be really
[5553.56s -> 5558.04s]  careful on with splitting grips, not going high for quite a long
[5558.04s -> 5560.08s]  time in terms of close to max.
[5561.00s -> 5564.60s]  So I would do at least three to four weeks of like, just making sure
[5564.60s -> 5566.28s]  that everything's happy base level.
[5566.92s -> 5570.16s]  You know, like you're splitting and you're, you're, you're stressing
[5570.16s -> 5573.92s]  your, um, cut by sheets in ways that it might not have experienced.
[5573.96s -> 5574.80s]  Like hardly ever.
[5575.32s -> 5578.96s]  Um, the other cool thing about training grip like this is when you hit like a
[5578.96s -> 5581.48s]  back to your pocket outside or something, you can just yard on them.
[5584.16s -> 5587.84s]  I have this like a famous AP plus in the UK or moonlight, and I could just
[5587.84s -> 5591.64s]  pinky monitor the style and just yard off the pinky monitor because he used
[5591.64s -> 5595.36s]  to monitor, but you can't get for a bloke.
[5595.36s -> 5599.04s]  He can't really get any of the fingering, um, just like weird
[5599.04s -> 5600.20s]  problems like that over the years.
[5600.28s -> 5605.08s]  There's a cool, like a, uh, band crag in the peak called crack David.
[5605.08s -> 5609.08s]  And there's a, I did this like variation of it called Riverdance.
[5609.08s -> 5613.44s]  And I remember, um, I think that was with Ned and you just sort of
[5613.44s -> 5617.24s]  rolled into this pocket, but it was like this square pocket, but it was like
[5617.24s -> 5621.96s]  perfect back to, and, uh, it just fits so well and all the other things
[5621.96s -> 5623.32s]  that's because you were crossing through.
[5623.32s -> 5625.52s]  It was quite tweaky to put any of the other fingers in.
[5626.44s -> 5628.32s]  And it was too small, essentially.
[5628.32s -> 5632.68s]  So sometimes you just find the whole outdoors that just fits and you could,
[5632.68s -> 5635.96s]  then you just do the problem because you're used to training in that way.
[5636.32s -> 5638.76s]  But it's like a weird side spin off of this method.
[5639.36s -> 5643.16s]  Um, but what I would say for the training is just make sure that
[5643.16s -> 5647.68s]  levels a nice body weight, which just gets the message through,
[5647.84s -> 5649.08s]  build that foundation.
[5649.44s -> 5655.12s]  And then when you feel ready, you can just push that into some like
[5655.68s -> 5658.80s]  slightly higher load, lower reps, just to try and sharpen it up.
[5659.16s -> 5662.84s]  But what I would say nowadays is don't go to max on it.
[5663.00s -> 5667.32s]  Just put it back into the grip that you want it to apply to, which is for you
[5667.32s -> 5673.04s]  would be half crimp and then hit that, you know, like in the way that you
[5673.16s -> 5674.20s]  you've been hitting it now.
[5674.76s -> 5678.52s]  And then hopefully you'll just have like a bit better stimulate.
[5678.52s -> 5680.64s]  Every finger will kind of know its job a bit better.
[5680.80s -> 5684.92s]  It'll stop trying to like, you know, share out the load and things in the
[5684.92s -> 5686.00s]  way that it's doing at the minute.
[5686.08s -> 5689.76s]  Hopefully things will just feel a bit more sparky in the way that
[5689.76s -> 5690.72s]  you can crush through them.
[5691.08s -> 5691.72s]  That's fascinating.
[5691.72s -> 5695.56s]  So it's almost like, you know, I'm going to isolate these different
[5695.56s -> 5699.68s]  finger combinations just to really wake them up just to wake the fingers up.
[5699.84s -> 5702.32s]  And then once they feel awake and they feel like they're firing a little
[5702.32s -> 5706.04s]  better, going back to four finger training to really pull hard.
[5706.24s -> 5707.08s]  Is that right?
[5708.92s -> 5709.12s]  Yeah.
[5709.68s -> 5709.92s]  Yeah.
[5709.92s -> 5714.72s]  And some of it's like, um, some of it won't apply.
[5714.72s -> 5717.60s]  Like you'll get gains when you split, which will just be your sheath
[5717.60s -> 5721.00s]  adaption, like learning how to bring the other fingers into play.
[5721.80s -> 5723.84s]  Um, but some of it applies really well.
[5724.04s -> 5729.64s]  And I think it, it is a method that, that does work, but again, it's
[5729.64s -> 5731.12s]  just one way of going about it.
[5731.20s -> 5736.08s]  Like, um, you could, you could never loads people never trained like this
[5736.20s -> 5741.96s]  and they just, um, you can still see games, but I do feel like it
[5741.96s -> 5743.28s]  is the blunt Boston rifle.
[5743.28s -> 5744.88s]  Like it's that they're just lucky.
[5744.96s -> 5748.40s]  Like they've hit the target and they've, they've hit it in a way
[5748.40s -> 5750.96s]  that has like enabled progression.
[5751.16s -> 5755.12s]  Um, but, and especially when I've looked at other sports, it's kind of
[5755.12s -> 5756.88s]  confirmed it to me in the last few years.
[5756.88s -> 5760.24s]  So I look at arm wrestling and how they break the wrist down and how
[5760.28s -> 5763.28s]  little climbers ever talk about risks.
[5763.64s -> 5768.00s]  And, uh, and yeah, it's like, it's the be all and end all of arm wrestling.
[5768.56s -> 5774.72s]  Um, but what's interesting is, uh, like they never talk about fingertips.
[5775.00s -> 5778.76s]  I've said a bit on the last podcast and, um, I've never heard that
[5778.76s -> 5783.00s]  mentioned the FTP tendon or the FTS tendon or stuff like that.
[5783.00s -> 5784.56s]  So it's really interesting.
[5784.56s -> 5786.84s]  Like what is meaningful for a sport?
[5786.88s -> 5790.84s]  They focus in on, they break down and you get this fascinating knowledge.
[5791.00s -> 5794.24s]  And I feel like a lot of good climbers at the minute that are onto that
[5794.64s -> 5796.12s]  are stealing from arm wrestling.
[5796.88s -> 5800.52s]  And, uh, and then the same goes for like grip.
[5800.92s -> 5805.40s]  Um, I mean, you've had Eve Gravel on and, um, there's another climber
[5805.40s -> 5807.76s]  that's a really fascinating crossover.
[5807.76s -> 5809.44s]  Who's been on last as well.
[5809.44s -> 5814.92s]  Tana, um, who's, um, again, like phenomenal grip athlete and
[5814.92s -> 5816.12s]  was a really good rock climber.
[5816.12s -> 5821.68s]  So there's these, there's these nice, um, human examples at the
[5821.68s -> 5826.12s]  minute of like crossover and ways of doing things for myself.
[5826.12s -> 5829.40s]  I'm like, I'm still all about the rock and just trying to
[5829.84s -> 5831.28s]  solve problems near my house.
[5831.36s -> 5833.16s]  Um, I'm basically a local doctor.
[5833.44s -> 5839.60s]  Um, I've been a little bit, but really I don't, I don't travel the loads.
[5839.68s -> 5844.68s]  Um, so like stuff I can drive to in Europe is usually my father.
[5844.72s -> 5849.04s]  Like I've been around a bit, like I've been up Norway through, uh, went with
[5849.04s -> 5851.56s]  Michaela commonality to Italy and stuff.
[5851.92s -> 5853.44s]  I haven't really been in Switzerland much.
[5853.44s -> 5853.80s]  Actually.
[5853.80s -> 5859.04s]  That's probably one of my weakest areas that I've in terms of visiting, but I've
[5859.04s -> 5864.04s]  got, um, to know font really well in the last, um, kind of five or six years.
[5864.16s -> 5866.76s]  I wish I'd kind of got a font sooner.
[5866.76s -> 5868.92s]  Cause I love my favorite style of climbing.
[5870.16s -> 5873.76s]  Sandstone, because it has the whole subtlety, which all this podcast has been
[5873.76s -> 5880.76s]  about, like robotic numbers and stuff destroys that it's just like, it just
[5880.76s -> 5884.64s]  says, Oh yeah, you've come with all your, your benchmarks and stuff like this.
[5884.68s -> 5889.32s]  But, you know, have like a big six feet plus like the Marga at East cities and
[5889.32s -> 5891.64s]  like, you know, just do it first.
[5891.64s -> 5897.16s]  Try go on, you know, six feet plus, but you know, there are very, very good
[5897.16s -> 5899.84s]  climbers that spent a long time on it.
[5899.88s -> 5901.60s]  But I love that style of climbing.
[5902.48s -> 5908.56s]  I'm very lucky in that Northumberland in my local area is full of font style
[5908.56s -> 5909.20s]  sandstone.
[5909.20s -> 5911.48s]  So when I go to font, it's like a busman's holiday.
[5911.48s -> 5913.36s]  I'm just like, Oh yeah, I know.
[5913.36s -> 5914.16s]  I know this game.
[5914.76s -> 5917.24s]  Uh, it's just, there's more of it and it's way better.
[5917.44s -> 5921.36s]  Um, uh, yeah, it's a magical place, um, for me for climbing.
[5921.64s -> 5927.40s]  Um, I think we're very lucky as Brits to have it so nearby and what's lovely
[5927.48s -> 5928.96s]  like the crossover there.
[5928.96s -> 5932.24s]  So just meeting people from other, other areas and stuff.
[5932.92s -> 5937.76s]  One of my best trips to font was, uh, I met Tim Doyle from school on issues
[5937.76s -> 5943.08s]  that proper dark costs probably shouldn't even mention, but yeah, it was
[5943.08s -> 5946.68s]  fascinating to see Tim's approach to climbing and just how parallel it was.
[5946.68s -> 5949.68s]  Like even the shoes he had in his bag and the fact that when you do a lot of
[5949.68s -> 5953.64s]  developing, you learn what heels work for what aspects, like you have your
[5953.68s -> 5957.80s]  catch heels, your sort of notch heels, your surface area heels.
[5957.88s -> 5961.60s]  And he even had like the kind of breakdown for those and also the
[5961.60s -> 5963.44s]  different toes and things like shoes.
[5963.44s -> 5966.72s]  You, you look at totally differently when you've done a lot of developing, I
[5966.72s -> 5971.64s]  feel than when you're like, just thinking about what shoe to buy for the gym or
[5971.64s -> 5976.60s]  whatever, you know, like we, we deliberately sniff out, yeah, what works
[5976.60s -> 5978.16s]  for what rock type and what aspects.
[5978.16s -> 5978.88s]  So it was cool.
[5978.88s -> 5983.36s]  Like even just to look at us, but like we were on jewel and, um, yeah, I could
[5983.36s -> 5986.88s]  just like know what shoe to wear because I could like cross equivalent
[5986.88s -> 5988.32s]  it from what they were wearing.
[5990.64s -> 5991.40s]  That's awesome.
[5992.24s -> 5992.52s]  Yeah.
[5992.64s -> 5994.96s]  It's so like, that's great.
[5994.96s -> 5996.56s]  That's the magic of climbing.
[5997.56s -> 5999.08s]  Do you want to talk about wrists?
[5999.12s -> 6002.48s]  I mean, I have some questions about wrist strength, because I thought that
[6002.48s -> 6006.16s]  was another area from our first conversation and from hearing you talk
[6006.16s -> 6011.00s]  with Tom and lattice that really stood out to me, um, I'd be interested in that,
[6011.00s -> 6012.36s]  but yeah, how are you feeling?
[6012.36s -> 6015.56s]  And is there anything else that you want to talk about with the finger test
[6015.60s -> 6018.00s]  that we haven't covered before we move on?
[6018.28s -> 6022.28s]  Yeah, probably 20 minutes to just hit me with, uh, I mean, I think we've
[6022.28s -> 6027.44s]  covered the finger test pretty well without kind of going, getting a bit
[6027.44s -> 6035.04s]  more half crimped data and, um, no, I reckon like, I think it just over
[6035.04s -> 6035.84s]  complicate things.
[6035.88s -> 6039.52s]  I think there are other things to chat about in there, but there's, there's
[6039.56s -> 6041.44s]  such good low hanging fruit there.
[6042.80s -> 6047.08s]  And that's where I kind of feel like that kind of diagnostics is best, like
[6047.08s -> 6051.96s]  trying to pick out all the vagaries and that and train from it, it's probably
[6051.96s -> 6057.64s]  too reductive and board climbing and climbing is just such a mishmash of
[6057.64s -> 6058.44s]  different things.
[6058.56s -> 6065.60s]  Um, but what I would say is, uh, I guess to, to stress on that finally, um,
[6066.12s -> 6071.72s]  the point of, it's the beginning point of a lot of our contact in climbing, but
[6071.72s -> 6077.12s]  it, it's, um, because it connects to everything else, which I can segue into
[6077.12s -> 6077.64s]  risks.
[6077.92s -> 6080.76s]  Uh, I feel like it has a knock on effect.
[6081.00s -> 6084.92s]  So if you can't high angle crimp and you're not strong to get in the back of
[6084.92s -> 6087.68s]  the hole, you're not going to be able to pull out on the whole.
[6087.76s -> 6090.56s]  If you can't pull out on the whole, you're not going to be able to move
[6090.56s -> 6091.64s]  slowly above the whole.
[6091.72s -> 6093.76s]  So hopefully this makes sense to people like it.
[6094.28s -> 6095.24s]  It's just physics.
[6095.24s -> 6099.80s]  Like if you can't access the input well and stabilize it as you move above it,
[6100.52s -> 6101.48s]  you're going to move quicker.
[6101.72s -> 6104.76s]  If you're going to move quicker, you're going to have to capture that load when
[6104.76s -> 6107.56s]  you hit, whatever you're going to and stop it.
[6108.52s -> 6111.48s]  And you either stop that by being good at swinging and cutting loose all the
[6111.48s -> 6117.28s]  time and having like a grip position that doesn't fail, or you're going to, um,
[6117.80s -> 6123.12s]  lean a rinse from body tension and just transfer the weight into your feet and
[6123.12s -> 6127.48s]  through your core and like do loads of little foot moves and get a little heel
[6127.48s -> 6132.00s]  on and, you know, like it has such a knock on effect, but that's also why
[6132.00s -> 6133.80s]  these things are so hard to track down.
[6133.84s -> 6139.60s]  So I think diagnostics great for just picking up on the black holes, but
[6139.80s -> 6145.20s]  unfortunately they, they won't help people's training if the hardest part is
[6145.20s -> 6148.20s]  then like getting the brain to fill that in.
[6148.24s -> 6151.64s]  Cause the reason why we develop these things and these styles is just like
[6151.68s -> 6155.92s]  everyone has their own way of moving and reprogramming, especially as you get
[6155.92s -> 6159.36s]  older is a case of old dog and new tricks.
[6159.40s -> 6165.20s]  Like it, it just takes a bit more of a shunt to kind of get the brain to, um,
[6165.24s -> 6173.04s]  to do it, but luckily it can be done and that I'm gradually, uh, and I really
[6173.04s -> 6179.00s]  enjoy that, like I'm, I'm very similar to, um, Ned's philosophy of thinking
[6179.04s -> 6181.64s]  that I really enjoy training my weaknesses and not my strengths.
[6181.76s -> 6185.64s]  I was thinking about this the other day and I think I could do a lot better if I
[6185.64s -> 6190.08s]  just train my strengths for sandstone because I think like, you know, I'm like
[6190.08s -> 6196.00s]  six foot odd, um, with, uh, I've only got like six foot two span though, but, um,
[6196.88s -> 6200.04s]  the height, because when you're compressing, you're often on a diagonal
[6200.04s -> 6203.08s]  and my span works out.
[6203.24s -> 6207.04s]  I've never really like not been able to span anything.
[6207.24s -> 6208.84s]  There's been a few times in front.
[6208.84s -> 6212.68s]  I've been close, but I've got up to stuff like end of me climbing by just
[6212.68s -> 6216.32s]  like relaxing my shoulders and just getting, getting the fun in.
[6216.36s -> 6221.20s]  But, um, but yeah, like if I trained, I've been trying to think like how I
[6221.20s -> 6225.08s]  would train my strengths for sandstone and if I should play around with that.
[6225.32s -> 6231.20s]  But I just think I enjoy turning my weaknesses, um, because for me, it's
[6231.20s -> 6234.48s]  more fun, it's like the low hanging fruit or as training your strengths.
[6235.48s -> 6239.92s]  Some climbers do it brilliantly and it's the best way to get up the grades, but
[6239.92s -> 6243.08s]  then you come into the whole philosophy of like, what are you climbing for?
[6243.08s -> 6249.52s]  Are you climbing for that personal satisfaction and, and a feeling of moving
[6249.52s -> 6254.20s]  over a rock or are you climbing to sort of prove something to yourself and other
[6254.20s -> 6257.76s]  people, you know, and it's not often never black and white.
[6257.76s -> 6259.88s]  It's like a, it's a blend, isn't it?
[6260.08s -> 6267.88s]  But, um, uh, I've spent so long, um, it's only been literally in the last two
[6267.88s -> 6271.80s]  years, I've had anything really to go out in the lakes of substance, thanks to
[6271.80s -> 6278.64s]  Aidan and now, but most of the things in the lakes are, um, projects that are in
[6278.64s -> 6284.12s]  fact, nearly all of them as projects that are either the standups mine or, um,
[6284.76s -> 6288.08s]  something I've had a relationship with in the past and I've known about, cause
[6288.08s -> 6289.48s]  it's really hard finding stuff.
[6289.52s -> 6294.32s]  You could talk to a whole podcast on how bloody hard it is finding rocks, but,
[6294.32s -> 6301.24s]  um, it's, uh, it's, so I've got those to go out now, but in Northumberland, I
[6301.24s -> 6306.72s]  don't, there hasn't been the kind of next generation development of kind of put up
[6306.72s -> 6307.20s]  things.
[6307.92s -> 6312.32s]  Um, it's still mostly me and the old boys rattling around over there and doing new
[6312.32s -> 6312.68s]  stuff.
[6312.88s -> 6317.16s]  So it's nice cause I have loads of projects to myself, but it's rubbish in
[6317.60s -> 6321.88s]  I just don't have like that shunt from the next generation, um, which will
[6321.88s -> 6325.76s]  likely come like, I'm sure, like there's so many good climbers popping up now
[6325.96s -> 6331.68s]  and we'll both be on date and the both quite semi local to the, um, in that
[6332.52s -> 6337.76s]  Aidan's got his band now and, um, wills from Edinburgh when he's up near his
[6337.76s -> 6338.08s]  family.
[6338.08s -> 6341.24s]  And actually that's only an hour down to where all those projects are.
[6341.24s -> 6345.88s]  So it's very likely in the next couple of years that the hard stuff will start
[6345.88s -> 6346.28s]  going up.
[6346.72s -> 6350.60s]  So if I want to take the county, I've got one that I know that pretty much
[6350.60s -> 6357.64s]  the problem with Chris and, uh, I haven't done it and it, it gave me a finger
[6357.64s -> 6357.88s]  injury.
[6358.04s -> 6362.00s]  I know if I'm on it and, um, I need to get that done.
[6362.76s -> 6367.08s]  And if I could get, if I can be asked to get that done, I think that's my only
[6367.08s -> 6367.44s]  window.
[6367.48s -> 6371.36s]  Cause I think when those boys get started, they'll be like, I'll be out of
[6371.36s -> 6373.08s]  the game, but that is the county.
[6373.12s -> 6373.92s]  I love that.
[6374.04s -> 6378.84s]  But there's like, there's not that many great problems there.
[6378.84s -> 6384.16s]  There's probably only, uh, 90 at the minute or something.
[6385.60s -> 6386.68s]  Sounds like a lot to me.
[6387.40s -> 6388.08s]  That's awesome.
[6389.24s -> 6393.88s]  Like we can be semi proud of it, but it's like 300.
[6395.60s -> 6395.88s]  Okay.
[6395.88s -> 6397.32s]  We've got about 15 minutes left.
[6397.32s -> 6399.92s]  Let's, uh, let's dive into the wrist training.
[6399.96s -> 6402.96s]  The first time you and I talked, you started by giving me a tour of your
[6402.96s -> 6408.48s]  training room here and I'm like staring at this beautiful climbing board behind
[6408.48s -> 6411.84s]  you, and I'm tempted to ask about that, but we can save that for, for round two.
[6412.56s -> 6420.28s]  Um, if you're up for that, but just pretend it's a cliff and climb, but yeah,
[6420.28s -> 6424.00s]  so you showed me all, you showed me your training setup and you showed me your
[6424.00s -> 6428.96s]  collection of grip implements and you said grip is like my staple food.
[6429.00s -> 6431.96s]  It's like the thing that you do all the time.
[6432.08s -> 6435.04s]  And so I'm really curious, very simply.
[6435.04s -> 6438.56s]  I mean, I know I asked about wrist training and that can certainly be your
[6438.56s -> 6443.68s]  answer or it can be connected to it, but what are most climbers neglecting?
[6443.68s -> 6449.60s]  And I'm curious if you had to just give every climber listening to this one
[6449.60s -> 6454.68s]  exercise to work on either for general grip training that translates to climbing
[6454.68s -> 6459.64s]  in your experience or specifically for targeting their wrist strength for climbing.
[6460.16s -> 6461.60s]  Is there anything that comes to mind?
[6461.72s -> 6463.52s]  Or is that even the right question to ask?
[6464.96s -> 6465.92s]  No, that's pretty good.
[6466.08s -> 6474.16s]  Um, I mean, like one arm half crimp dead hang would be like your great,
[6474.24s -> 6476.88s]  uh, staple that it just were.
[6477.28s -> 6477.56s]  Huh.
[6477.60s -> 6478.96s]  I was not expecting that answer.
[6478.96s -> 6479.60s]  That's interesting.
[6480.76s -> 6482.68s]  Um, you think that gets the wrist?
[6484.04s -> 6487.84s]  No, not the wrist at all, but like just in terms of like, if you were on
[6487.84s -> 6489.52s]  about wanting to train or whatever.
[6489.52s -> 6489.84s]  Okay.
[6489.88s -> 6490.24s]  Gotcha.
[6490.36s -> 6490.64s]  Gotcha.
[6490.92s -> 6497.24s]  I just think it's a lot of basis, but in terms of the risk, um, the real
[6497.24s -> 6501.24s]  interesting thing now is like, um, indoor and outdoor climbing, uh, kind
[6501.24s -> 6506.04s]  of diverging and, um, indoor climbing still isn't hitting the wrist with
[6506.04s -> 6507.24s]  a lot of indoor climbing holes.
[6507.52s -> 6511.04s]  They're making all these big, uh, fiberglass holes, but they keep
[6511.04s -> 6512.04s]  putting the hole at the front.
[6512.44s -> 6515.72s]  Because it's more interesting if you like curve it and carve the pinch
[6515.72s -> 6519.32s]  and things, and they're not putting the hold over the back, like the
[6519.36s -> 6523.00s]  font slope has hit you or some of those granite curves.
[6523.56s -> 6528.52s]  Um, like, uh, I'm trying to think of what areas have kind of like, you
[6528.52s -> 6532.04s]  see, slopers are a little bit niche depending on where you live.
[6532.68s -> 6538.04s]  Like if you live in the sands, you know, the sandstone in states got
[6538.04s -> 6540.80s]  loads of hard elements of that style.
[6541.00s -> 6544.92s]  Um, but I would imagine, I mean, I've only climbed a couple of areas in
[6544.96s -> 6550.84s]  America, but, um, yeah, like, uh, Joe's Valley or something.
[6551.56s -> 6555.16s]  It, you could probably play like spot the sloper and not do very well.
[6555.96s -> 6560.28s]  Like it's an area with a crap ton of crimps and pockets and a true slope,
[6560.44s -> 6563.80s]  like with bent sloper, it's just not that applicable.
[6563.88s -> 6567.32s]  Whereas say like, um, in little cottonwood, which if you're a salt
[6567.32s -> 6572.36s]  lake local, it's going to be on your same sort of hit this where you want to go.
[6572.92s -> 6576.80s]  Um, that's that, is it bear claw traverse or something like that?
[6576.80s -> 6581.68s]  I think I did that on my first day in America, but, um, just like loads of
[6581.68s -> 6586.64s]  slopers, uh, so be traverse in the main area where I'm copperhead and stuff is.
[6587.32s -> 6593.96s]  And, uh, it's, it's got something to do with, uh, yeah, I don't know that one.
[6594.56s -> 6594.60s]  Yeah.
[6597.32s -> 6597.68s]  Anyway.
[6598.16s -> 6599.40s]  Um, yeah.
[6599.44s -> 6603.72s]  Granted it's full of slopers if, um, if you want to go looking for them.
[6604.04s -> 6608.68s]  Uh, so whereas, yeah, so indoor to outdoors, I think this is where
[6608.68s -> 6611.24s]  people will see a big hole.
[6611.64s -> 6614.68s]  And again, like we've talked a bit about black hole in training.
[6614.68s -> 6618.76s]  So if you just climb in the gym, you get good in the gym, you get good on
[6618.76s -> 6622.72s]  the board, you get flicky and then you suddenly try and squeeze something
[6622.76s -> 6624.56s]  outdoors with a massively bent rest.
[6624.72s -> 6626.60s]  You're going to quickly realize that that thing's going to
[6626.60s -> 6628.04s]  fail within one or two goes.
[6628.72s -> 6629.76s]  You probably get a load of risk.
[6630.24s -> 6634.28s]  You might get a clunky wrist and then you just come away being a bit like,
[6634.28s -> 6635.92s]  Oh, that was a battle.
[6636.80s -> 6640.84s]  Um, whereas if you've trained your wrist and you've like, if you had an arm
[6640.84s -> 6644.20s]  wrestlers level of wrist strength, you'd just be like, Oh, that's total joke.
[6644.96s -> 6648.76s]  So, um, yeah, climbers can be pretty bad at overlooking wrist strength.
[6649.08s -> 6653.76s]  And I don't know many climbers that really target it.
[6654.08s -> 6658.76s]  It's a bit niche, but we had, um, I just do it for the fun of it really.
[6658.92s -> 6661.00s]  And, um, it doesn't apply it again.
[6661.00s -> 6661.88s]  It's total junk.
[6662.08s -> 6665.36s]  It doesn't work in the lakes on six million cut crimps.
[6665.88s -> 6672.56s]  Um, what I would say is don't overlook the expenses and stabilizing the rest
[6672.56s -> 6676.64s]  when it's in the extensive position, which again, like there's a divergence
[6676.68s -> 6680.40s]  between climbing and arm wrestling because they never train their wrist
[6680.40s -> 6685.40s]  back really, because essentially you're looking at a loss, so you never
[6685.40s -> 6686.56s]  really want your risk to go back.
[6686.64s -> 6691.52s]  But in climbing, we climb all pretty much all board climbing is like neutral
[6691.52s -> 6696.92s]  or extensive, like barely ever get on your flexes, but pretty much all.
[6697.60s -> 6702.20s]  Sandstone curvy squeezing or gritstone curvy squeezing is on your flexes.
[6702.40s -> 6706.28s]  Like if you're going around the curve, your wrist is flexed slightly.
[6706.72s -> 6708.64s]  Whenever it's flexed, it's activated.
[6709.28s -> 6711.48s]  And when it's activated, it's got a pull pretty hard.
[6711.80s -> 6717.28s]  And then you get into stabilization of pronation and supination and like your
[6717.28s -> 6719.96s]  paddle on a sloper and how that paddle works.
[6720.48s -> 6725.00s]  And, um, so hopefully that'll like explain things to people a bit as to
[6725.00s -> 6731.16s]  maybe why it could be a priority priority, but I really feel like it'll just
[6731.16s -> 6734.88s]  depend on where you live and because if you're small climbing as well and
[6734.92s -> 6739.44s]  things and tried climbing, I just don't think you need it.
[6740.24s -> 6745.52s]  I think, I think it, you'll occasionally hit like a break or something that
[6745.52s -> 6750.44s]  might be slopey and it sucks if you're pumped because you just fall off like
[6750.96s -> 6753.92s]  slopers plus pump for like horrendous.
[6753.92s -> 6754.20s]  Aren't they?
[6754.20s -> 6758.20s]  If you've been to those sport climbing areas that have like, there's a few
[6758.20s -> 6761.92s]  routes in Australia and things that are a bit like that, that's when you kind
[6761.92s -> 6766.52s]  of get that vomit pump rather than the, you know, just the forearm pump.
[6766.88s -> 6772.36s]  Um, but yeah, when, uh, it'll, it just depends on where you live.
[6772.36s -> 6775.88s]  And, and again, like indoors, it does help.
[6775.92s -> 6781.80s]  There's a lot of other weird wrist strengths and actually like, um, Guppy
[6781.80s -> 6787.36s]  strengths on volumes is way more beneficial in comps than like your sloper strength.
[6787.52s -> 6789.28s]  What strength say that word again?
[6790.28s -> 6791.48s]  Guppy.
[6791.72s -> 6792.00s]  Oh yeah.
[6792.00s -> 6794.44s]  That's another one that gets, uh, what does that mean?
[6797.64s -> 6802.32s]  So like, you know, loads of volumes of triangles and you essentially just flex
[6802.32s -> 6809.20s]  your, uh, and your, your, um, it's like a meat wrap grip or something like that.
[6809.80s -> 6810.00s]  Yeah.
[6810.00s -> 6812.96s]  Meat wrap where you're like squeezing between your palm and your fingers.
[6813.72s -> 6813.96s]  Yeah.
[6815.12s -> 6815.40s]  Yeah.
[6816.24s -> 6820.44s]  And yeah, and you often have a lot of wrist flexion, but that's
[6820.44s -> 6821.64s]  actually how I injured my arm.
[6822.16s -> 6827.32s]  Uh, was on a downhill volume meat wrap and I was like pulling really
[6827.32s -> 6829.36s]  hard, making up an element in the gym.
[6829.60s -> 6833.12s]  And, uh, and I'd just been there too long.
[6833.84s -> 6835.28s]  I've been there like three hours.
[6836.04s -> 6838.92s]  Um, my wife and I had like the odd, one of these rare days
[6838.92s -> 6839.84s]  where we didn't have kids.
[6840.56s -> 6843.52s]  And, uh, I forgot that I was massively unconditioned.
[6843.72s -> 6850.28s]  And, uh, and yeah, I just tweaked it, but it's taken ages to, to fix.
[6850.36s -> 6855.12s]  And I was probably tired from playing around with doing silly wrist things as
[6855.12s -> 6855.44s]  well.
[6856.20s -> 6860.96s]  Uh, but yeah, those, those guppies or meat wraps on volumes can be really
[6860.96s -> 6865.08s]  pinky based if you hit them on the outside or index based and that's
[6865.08s -> 6869.72s]  massively pronator and supinator, um, dependent.
[6870.16s -> 6874.92s]  And then in terms of deviation and what an arm wrestler would call the riser,
[6875.16s -> 6878.60s]  which is, uh, it's like abduction and adoption, isn't it?
[6878.60s -> 6884.16s]  If you risk, but, um, yeah, those are all things that people might want to
[6884.16s -> 6887.72s]  pay attention to if you wanting to work on that strength comps.
[6888.40s -> 6892.20s]  And, um, cause again, like it's non-existent in fingerboarding,
[6892.44s -> 6897.24s]  non-existent in board climbing, but it's hugely important in competition nowadays.
[6897.84s -> 6903.56s]  Um, it's tough, almost non-existent outdoors, like where triangles, like I
[6903.56s -> 6909.28s]  can, I can name a few problems, like RSK is actually quite triangular in Scotland
[6909.56s -> 6913.08s]  that has a lot of day for clouds, how the problems on like a really
[6913.08s -> 6914.92s]  cool a, a, they're called triangulation.
[6916.76s -> 6917.20s]  There you go.
[6918.48s -> 6922.20s]  Um, there's like, yeah, it's just full of like, but that has quite a few
[6922.84s -> 6927.56s]  in that indoor style, but like, as a rule, they're just super
[6927.56s -> 6928.96s]  rare to find that feature.
[6929.04s -> 6930.16s]  Right, right.
[6931.40s -> 6935.12s]  There's another eight bearded up at the pre-sale actually, if you want to, I
[6935.12s -> 6940.68s]  quite like playing the, think of the exceptions to the rule game triangular
[6940.68s -> 6945.52s]  volume copies on, um, but, um, yeah.
[6945.52s -> 6950.08s]  And then, and again, like, uh, that's just got some weirdness that have like
[6950.12s -> 6955.28s]  knee bars and guppies, and that was enough for like teenage agent to get a bit
[6955.28s -> 6962.16s]  confused, eat it up nowadays, but, um, but yeah, it was, it's, it just shows
[6962.16s -> 6964.20s]  that multifactorial element in climbing.
[6964.36s -> 6969.72s]  Um, but again, like some people have mastered that, you know, like nobody
[6969.72s -> 6971.44s]  can mention knee bars without Dave Graham.
[6971.44s -> 6973.20s]  And you just think like that.
[6973.24s -> 6977.72s]  And some of these, uh, sport climbers now as well, next level.
[6978.68s -> 6981.48s]  Applying that I'm kind of all for that.
[6981.52s -> 6985.16s]  There's been quite a few debates in British climbing about, you know, pads
[6985.16s -> 6989.96s]  on no pads, knee bars on no knee bars and stuff just seems a bit silly to me.
[6989.96s -> 6991.56s]  Cause there's so much rock in the world.
[6992.08s -> 6995.64s]  And it's only when, if you're precious about one route and you tried really
[6995.64s -> 6998.92s]  hard and you did it without knee bar, it feels crappy when someone comes and does
[6998.92s -> 7004.44s]  it, but if you look at the whole picture, it's just crazy to think like there are
[7004.44s -> 7007.40s]  so many climbs in the world that you can't get a knee bar on.
[7008.04s -> 7010.68s]  Then it's a valid technique.
[7010.92s -> 7012.52s]  It's an, it's actually quite fun.
[7012.56s -> 7014.52s]  Like I've got a lot of respect for that technique.
[7014.76s -> 7019.36s]  Um, like I hate it sometimes for like the awkwardness of it.
[7019.44s -> 7021.60s]  Like you do, it does restrict your movement a little bit.
[7021.60s -> 7027.68s]  If you're not expert on how to apply the pad and things, but, um, it's, uh, it's
[7027.68s -> 7033.12s]  an art, you know, I can respect any, anything like that.
[7033.36s -> 7033.96s]  It is.
[7033.96s -> 7037.60s]  I just was thinking about, um, I've done quite a lot of knee barring and
[7037.76s -> 7040.16s]  I'm sure I'm not an expert at it, but I've done a fair bit of it.
[7040.16s -> 7043.28s]  And I was just immediately when you said that, I was, I was just thinking
[7043.28s -> 7046.84s]  about a route that I climbed a couple of years ago, I think it was an eight
[7046.84s -> 7052.44s]  a route and, uh, I, it was like a knee bar scum under a roof, and then you
[7052.44s -> 7056.56s]  have to extend and like dead point a crimp above that, and it was, I've, I've
[7056.56s -> 7062.36s]  never before or since done a move like this, where it was all about locking in
[7062.36s -> 7066.04s]  the lower body below the waist and making sure that you didn't move at all.
[7066.04s -> 7070.16s]  Cause if you moved the knee bar would come out and then generating and doing
[7070.16s -> 7073.88s]  a dynamic dead point with your upper body, you know, it was so bizarre
[7073.92s -> 7077.68s]  and just getting that per, and it was, it was absolutely tipped out for me.
[7077.68s -> 7079.36s]  Like I, I didn't have any margin.
[7079.36s -> 7083.68s]  I had to be at full extension to latch the crimp and it was just so weird.
[7083.68s -> 7088.64s]  You know, it's like everything in your, in your previous experience is telling
[7088.64s -> 7093.64s]  you to generate through the legs and the hips, um, but just to isolate those
[7093.64s -> 7096.72s]  two things and separate them and compartmentalize them like that.
[7096.72s -> 7101.48s]  I mean, it took me so many tries to get the hang of this move and it's just,
[7101.48s -> 7103.16s]  yeah, it's just totally different, but really fun.
[7104.44s -> 7106.84s]  That's like a crunch punch or something, isn't it?
[7108.68s -> 7110.72s]  Flopping your upper body towards the rock.
[7112.88s -> 7113.08s]  Yeah.
[7113.08s -> 7116.84s]  That's, I mean, exactly like what the movement's just brilliant
[7116.84s -> 7117.52s]  incline, isn't it?
[7117.52s -> 7122.24s]  Sometimes to miss out on that would be a shame for me, but like I respect
[7123.20s -> 7127.12s]  don't do it because I like seeing power and climbing as well and just like brute
[7127.12s -> 7131.80s]  force, but there's a place for both of them, you know, and I think it's pretty
[7131.80s -> 7135.08s]  much that's been and gone now, like new bars look like that.
[7135.64s -> 7136.84s]  They're pretty much here to stay.
[7136.92s -> 7139.24s]  I'm seeing them on all the heart problems and routes.
[7140.00s -> 7142.32s]  It seems like that's been the big boom in sport climbing.
[7142.32s -> 7142.68s]  Actually.
[7142.68s -> 7147.04s]  It isn't like we've all got way stronger in the last 10 years.
[7147.08s -> 7148.76s]  We just worked out how it rests probably.
[7148.88s -> 7154.16s]  And then stuck the difficulty on, just to like massively overgeneralize.
[7160.00s -> 7163.52s]  Well, Dan, I've, I got a bunch of listener questions for you and for people
[7163.52s -> 7167.76s]  listening, thank you guys, everyone who submitted questions.
[7167.76s -> 7173.20s]  A lot of them were around high angle crimps, different grip positions, how
[7173.20s -> 7176.64s]  that's impacted your own climbing to focus on high angle crimps and these
[7176.68s -> 7178.88s]  different things, what you learned from Aiden, et cetera.
[7179.24s -> 7182.48s]  So I think we covered pretty much, I think we covered most of them.
[7182.48s -> 7184.04s]  We definitely didn't get to all of them.
[7184.56s -> 7187.64s]  And for you guys that submitted questions, I'll save your questions
[7188.00s -> 7190.76s]  for our next conversation and hopefully we can get into more of those.
[7191.44s -> 7194.68s]  But I have two questions here that I want to ask you before I let you go.
[7195.60s -> 7196.68s]  And they're a little bit more general.
[7196.68s -> 7203.32s]  They're just looking back at your own climbing journey, given the degree to
[7203.32s -> 7206.64s]  which you think about all this stuff and all these different chapters you've
[7206.64s -> 7210.88s]  had in, you know, this, this blunderbuss rifle thing, and really
[7210.88s -> 7212.64s]  focusing in on specific things.
[7213.68s -> 7217.68s]  What do you wish you had started doing earlier, if anything?
[7219.96s -> 7228.52s]  Forming an athletic community to base the foundation on, that's
[7228.52s -> 7229.64s]  like really easy to answer actually.
[7230.48s -> 7235.68s]  Um, so I, but then what's weird, cause like you're asking for history to be
[7235.68s -> 7241.56s]  different, but, um, cause climbing was like a bit more grunge, garage-based
[7242.28s -> 7248.08s]  DIY boards and training was a bit more underground, something you
[7248.08s -> 7249.44s]  whispered between your mates.
[7250.52s -> 7255.76s]  So to go from that to like full blown, like, Oh, I'm going to like hit the
[7255.76s -> 7259.44s]  gym and develop a really balanced physique and get, and
[7259.44s -> 7260.76s]  then tailor it to climbing.
[7260.96s -> 7264.56s]  Would be like, just mental to think of doing that in the 2000s.
[7264.68s -> 7267.80s]  Whereas now I think that's what the kids are doing to get the next level up
[7267.92s -> 7272.48s]  because ultimately the pitfall of just going down the road of boards and
[7272.48s -> 7277.48s]  fingerboards, which I think I, I was lucky in that I guessed that pretty
[7277.48s -> 7286.16s]  well in my late teens and, um, for myself, uh, I guess not regardless of
[7286.20s -> 7290.92s]  grades, like it's just given me the option of basically hoovering up a lot
[7290.92s -> 7296.52s]  of blank rock and projects, um, and managing to solve those puzzles, which
[7296.52s -> 7301.68s]  is really satisfying and also being able to kind of repeat a lot of past
[7301.68s -> 7303.04s]  test pieces in the UK.
[7304.04s -> 7308.12s]  Um, uh, and, and so like, I've kind of got out of climbing a lot of what I
[7308.32s -> 7313.40s]  wanted and I feel like I've managed to, I I'm really lucky in that I've had
[7313.40s -> 7318.48s]  the satisfaction, the personal satisfaction, which can only ever be for
[7318.72s -> 7322.24s]  oneself in that I feel like there's been a few times where I've managed to
[7322.24s -> 7325.32s]  climb things on rocks that have been very close to what I could possibly
[7325.32s -> 7328.72s]  achieve, um, at that particular moment in time.
[7329.00s -> 7333.08s]  Now those styles have changed over the years, but I could definitely
[7333.08s -> 7339.04s]  have climbed harder with more of that athletic approach, but would I change it?
[7339.72s -> 7344.36s]  Um, like I'm, I'm glad I got into bouldering at a time when, you know,
[7344.36s -> 7349.76s]  like 2002, 2003 was when I started putting up problems outside in my late
[7349.76s -> 7353.96s]  teens and that really feels like the boom time of bouldering, you know,
[7353.96s -> 7355.60s]  like what was Bishop like then?
[7355.60s -> 7360.88s]  And, you know, Fred Nicole was just starting to explore those areas.
[7360.88s -> 7363.76s]  And, uh, you know, look, I've been lucky enough to meet some
[7364.08s -> 7369.84s]  over the years who, yeah, he flew through Bishop around that time and
[7369.84s -> 7371.52s]  did that goldfish trombone and things.
[7374.84s -> 7378.72s]  Um, but yeah, and then like, yeah, the Mandala and spectra and things
[7378.72s -> 7381.32s]  of, they were also inspiring at that time.
[7381.36s -> 7387.00s]  And I wasn't anywhere near that level in those days, but, um, just to, uh,
[7387.72s -> 7391.40s]  to have been around bouldering and to have been like, even just sort of
[7391.40s -> 7395.92s]  an observer at that time, I feel like that has been such a cool period of
[7395.92s -> 7402.12s]  bouldering from like those days to where it is now has really felt like a, a
[7402.12s -> 7407.40s]  really interesting thing to have been involved with, um, so yeah, like, uh,
[7407.44s -> 7409.80s]  but yeah, I'll, I'll stop rubbing.
[7411.68s -> 7411.92s]  Yeah.
[7411.92s -> 7412.64s]  More of an athlete.
[7414.28s -> 7418.04s]  And then, uh, what do you think you would need to focus on to get
[7418.04s -> 7419.60s]  to the next level for yourself?
[7420.36s -> 7423.76s]  Whether that's V15 or S or some specific boulder that you want to do.
[7423.76s -> 7426.68s]  That seems like the next level boulder for you personally.
[7428.68s -> 7437.04s]  Yeah, I think, um, I'd be happy just climbing, um, like for me, uh, I'm, I'm
[7437.04s -> 7444.92s]  very, I just like see British grading and grades in general, in terms of like,
[7445.60s -> 7449.64s]  uh, the amount of times I've climbed like eight big second girl or eight
[7449.64s -> 7452.96s]  big clubs, like the Alchemist in under an hour in font, and then spent like,
[7453.76s -> 7460.40s]  I'll just spend like three years on something in the UK, because I can't
[7460.40s -> 7467.36s]  touch the eight C's in my County because the Gaskin doesn't, um, I couldn't
[7467.36s -> 7471.76s]  really like, I give loads of shit about training and strength and like, like
[7471.84s -> 7473.08s]  you can measure a dead Hank.
[7473.12s -> 7479.72s]  So I'd love to get my, um, one arm less than 20 mil drag up to cool.
[7479.76s -> 7487.60s]  Like maybe I should go for 110 kilo total or, um, I'd like to, um, I've
[7487.60s -> 7492.44s]  never done one five nine, but God doing one five eight was like the most
[7492.44s -> 7493.52s]  useless part of camp.
[7493.72s -> 7497.96s]  You're like, I think campus things, campus things, brilliant on hold and
[7497.96s -> 7504.20s]  campus thing problems is amazing, but I think campus boarding, uh, it's a good
[7504.20s -> 7508.08s]  way to get loads of movement and grams that you are never going to use outside.
[7508.60s -> 7515.12s]  And most people really encompassing and body that they, they don't
[7515.12s -> 7516.20s]  tend to be the best movies.
[7517.16s -> 7524.00s]  Um, so like, yeah, those feats of strength, I'd love to work towards, I guess
[7524.04s -> 7529.52s]  you can train those in the house, but, um, outdoors I'd be chuffed if I could
[7529.52s -> 7534.72s]  repeat a bunch of Aiden stuff locally in the lakes, like there's a bunch of
[7534.72s -> 7538.72s]  kind of eight plus eight C ish problems in the lakes, which I would love to do.
[7538.72s -> 7544.40s]  So like, um, and a lot of them has been projects that I've left and I know I can
[7544.40s -> 7548.56s]  do them like, um, Leopold said, I've done all the news and that's like an AC
[7548.56s -> 7550.08s]  agent did just earlier this year.
[7550.72s -> 7552.56s]  The problem for me is I just get distracted.
[7552.56s -> 7558.36s]  I'm very motivated by just having a nice day out climbing and being out in nature.
[7558.40s -> 7563.80s]  So if the conditions are better and, and I get really sucked into lines, like we
[7563.80s -> 7567.72s]  haven't really chatted about highballs and stuff, but if there's a bigger, better
[7567.72s -> 7569.28s]  line, I'll just go for that.
[7569.52s -> 7570.60s]  It doesn't matter if it's easier.
[7570.92s -> 7578.92s]  Like I love the aesthetics and the purity of like the challenge.
[7579.08s -> 7583.84s]  And, um, that's why, so I'll spend like days stomping around trying to find like
[7584.96s -> 7587.24s]  a big independent line to get inspired by.
[7587.36s -> 7590.44s]  So I've got one lined up for this winter, actually, I've got time on the grid.
[7591.48s -> 7594.28s]  I don't really care if people do it before me now as well.
[7594.40s -> 7596.12s]  Um, but I would love to do that.
[7596.48s -> 7603.88s]  Uh, so, and then that for me would be like another line on the grid that I would
[7603.88s -> 7608.44s]  just be like super inspired to take off into the memory banks with me.
[7608.80s -> 7614.56s]  Um, whereas yeah, with, with grades, I just get like frustrated just for
[7614.56s -> 7618.64s]  the personal British history and I love where we are now with the sport with it.
[7619.52s -> 7624.28s]  But yeah, compared to the little bit of climbing that I've done abroad and
[7624.28s -> 7630.80s]  things like, I think a lot of I'm sort of, yeah, um, it's for me, it's just like
[7630.84s -> 7635.68s]  wicked to see, um, the talent that we've got coming through now and that are
[7635.96s -> 7640.60s]  traveling and stuff and people can just see kind of the, the British climate
[7640.60s -> 7641.88s]  seems pretty strong and healthy.
[7642.16s -> 7648.92s]  Um, but what matters to me is kind of that, um, I get quite, you know, it
[7648.92s -> 7650.48s]  doesn't matter to me about the grade.
[7650.48s -> 7654.64s]  If I've put a lot of effort into a climb outside, it's more about just
[7654.64s -> 7658.32s]  chatting to my peers and I'm really lucky in that a lot of my problems
[7658.32s -> 7660.00s]  are very well respected.
[7660.00s -> 7665.32s]  So between my, my problems in the lakes that Aiden's repeated, I feel like
[7666.08s -> 7667.16s]  they mean a lot to him.
[7667.60s -> 7671.20s]  Um, they weren't just like any old AP plus or whatever.
[7671.48s -> 7676.16s]  Um, which is, you know, like that matters to me more than having a good
[7676.16s -> 7677.60s]  chat about the sequence and stuff.
[7677.80s -> 7684.96s]  Um, but, uh, yeah, so I would love, everybody wants to progress, but, um,
[7686.08s -> 7690.44s]  I think for me, yeah, I guess there's like, there's eight season fun
[7690.48s -> 7691.84s]  I'd love to do that are on my list.
[7693.16s -> 7693.44s]  Yeah.
[7693.48s -> 7694.28s]  It's just time.
[7694.40s -> 7698.68s]  I don't think I've really got the time to like, I'd have to try and take
[7698.68s -> 7701.84s]  some pretty quickly, which I think I can do for like, I've picked so many
[7701.84s -> 7703.48s]  things quite quickly and fun.
[7703.56s -> 7705.80s]  Cause I've never had a trip longer than three weeks there.
[7706.52s -> 7708.96s]  So I'm used to doing stuff between one and two weeks.
[7709.12s -> 7711.68s]  I've had one three week trip.
[7712.88s -> 7713.24s]  Yeah.
[7713.84s -> 7714.00s]  Yeah.
[7714.00s -> 7718.88s]  So I've had loads of two week trips, which if you know anything about, you
[7718.88s -> 7724.20s]  know, like if you get bad skin on your first two days, that's 50%
[7724.20s -> 7725.36s]  of your trip with bad skin.
[7725.36s -> 7725.92s]  So I'm right.
[7725.92s -> 7727.72s]  Or if it rains for the first week in font.
[7728.76s -> 7729.04s]  Yeah.
[7729.32s -> 7730.28s]  Which was my last trip.
[7730.56s -> 7735.60s]  It was like, and, um, but I've been really lucky and I've had some great
[7735.60s -> 7737.60s]  weather trips over the years and stuff.
[7737.60s -> 7739.80s]  So I've got through a lot of what I wanted to do in front.
[7740.00s -> 7743.76s]  Um, so actually, and I kind of worked my way up.
[7743.80s -> 7747.24s]  So I've only really got a lot of that harder stuff to do above
[7747.48s -> 7751.68s]  AB plus and above is where I've got a huge hole in like my font resume.
[7751.80s -> 7754.04s]  So actually stuff, yeah.
[7754.04s -> 7757.96s]  Like the big Island, um, that's the last of the old black star
[7757.96s -> 7759.28s]  rates I haven't ticked in front.
[7759.52s -> 7760.56s]  I've done the rest of them.
[7760.72s -> 7766.64s]  Um, the, of the new black star rates, I've got a few more, but it's under eight, I
[7766.64s -> 7771.88s]  think, but again, that's a crap measurement because there's so many things that are
[7771.88s -> 7773.28s]  good in front that have no stars.
[7773.36s -> 7778.28s]  And now I think I'm just looking at the new problems that have been put up like
[7778.48s -> 7782.64s]  Thomas Colin young and Oliver LeBreton, uh, amazing and inspiring that they're in
[7782.64s -> 7785.16s]  the forties and still doing incredible line.
[7785.32s -> 7792.48s]  Um, and then Gillian Huber and cool young developer in font, um, very, very
[7792.48s -> 7793.28s]  inspiring stuff.
[7793.28s -> 7798.16s]  So, um, but I've got those to go and I've got the kind of the hard stuff.
[7798.20s -> 7801.68s]  So like delirious, I'd love to do, I kind of spotted that before.
[7801.68s -> 7807.72s]  And that's an AC of, uh, Charles's, um, yeah, big Island.
[7807.84s -> 7808.68s]  I'd love to try.
[7808.84s -> 7812.96s]  So it's just like, if I get a trip and the weather's good and they're there, I'll,
[7813.16s -> 7818.04s]  I'll get stuck in, but I'll have to, I do need to kind of get, I mean, I'm in the
[7818.04s -> 7823.72s]  thick of it with like young kids and, um, and just general, like, you know, I'm
[7823.72s -> 7826.88s]  working with young kids and I'm doing my house at the minute.
[7827.88s -> 7835.36s]  I'm not like I'm playing the long game and, uh, but not by choice and, uh, yeah,
[7835.36s -> 7837.52s]  I think I've done, but I'm just happy.
[7837.52s -> 7843.00s]  Like if I can, I've been really happy with kind of a lot of these training
[7843.00s -> 7845.24s]  styles that I'm emulating from Aiden and things.
[7845.24s -> 7850.72s]  And, um, I just feel like maybe to demonstrate to people that would be it.
[7851.16s -> 7855.92s]  So that's partly why I would like to repeat those problems, but I feel like a
[7856.00s -> 7858.48s]  lot of the problems Aiden's done, they're a bit binary.
[7858.48s -> 7863.08s]  You can do them or you can't in the, a lot of them are so power based in
[7863.08s -> 7868.68s]  the fingers, especially that you tend to make them look easy-ish if you can do
[7868.68s -> 7874.12s]  them, if you can pass that bar, whereas, um, there aren't too many tricks.
[7874.28s -> 7877.92s]  Um, there are a few because he's done a few things so quickly.
[7877.92s -> 7880.88s]  It's just missed the best beta, but, um, yeah.
[7880.88s -> 7885.56s]  So there are inspiring lines in the lakes for me to work on, but yeah,
[7885.56s -> 7890.16s]  I'm just like, I'm quite, uh, easy come, easy go.
[7890.32s -> 7891.92s]  I love training and work on that.
[7892.04s -> 7897.12s]  But in terms of climbing, I just, um, I've, I value sort of
[7897.32s -> 7898.96s]  happiness over performance.
[7899.48s -> 7904.56s]  So that just means going with my heart and what really inspires me.
[7904.76s -> 7911.16s]  I know that can be an AA slab, a seven C plus or a manual because those are
[7911.84s -> 7917.48s]  like, if you've tried any British manuals, um, AA manual is pretty full on.
[7917.72s -> 7921.28s]  Um, I can't, I can't even imagine what that would feel like.
[7921.32s -> 7921.60s]  Yeah.
[7923.32s -> 7923.56s]  Yeah.
[7923.56s -> 7925.00s]  There's some sandbags in Britain.
[7925.08s -> 7929.80s]  I like stuff like, like, like Ned's, Ned Zeppelin or, um, we, we went to this
[7929.80s -> 7933.60s]  place called Hell's Mantle on the grid and that's still got some great projects.
[7933.96s -> 7938.92s]  Um, but I got, um, me and Ned and Dave Sutcliffe all went and we were just
[7938.96s -> 7940.68s]  missing Ben's Ben Bransby.
[7940.68s -> 7944.28s]  He's like one of the other best mantlers and, um, we would have had like the
[7944.28s -> 7947.24s]  dream team, but we had three or four that were pretty good.
[7947.56s -> 7954.60s]  And, um, Uh, again, like that was a bit mid summer, but I went back in really
[7954.60s -> 7958.44s]  good conditions and did this kind of like hybrid problem with a bit of hard
[7958.44s -> 7962.28s]  crimping and then like a seven C plus mental that me and Ned did previously.
[7962.48s -> 7966.96s]  And, um, just like that, I find really inspiring because it's like a different
[7966.96s -> 7968.48s]  style and fun to work on.
[7968.48s -> 7972.64s]  And, um, so yeah, just local projects for me, it was motivating.
[7972.64s -> 7979.32s]  That's, um, uh, a sort of something that's would be like a big number
[7979.32s -> 7982.44s]  that's, um, gonna like turn heads.
[7982.64s -> 7985.88s]  Um, because that that's kind of, I mean, I'm lucky in that I'm in a low
[7985.88s -> 7987.72s]  pressure, I don't need to turn heads.
[7987.76s -> 7990.72s]  So I'm inclined to just go that way.
[7993.08s -> 7994.00s]  Well, awesome, man.
[7994.20s -> 7997.00s]  I think it's, uh, I've been greedy with you.
[7997.00s -> 7999.68s]  I think it's time for you to put your kids to bed, but I just want
[7999.68s -> 8001.72s]  to say, I really appreciate this.
[8001.80s -> 8003.20s]  This is so fun for me.
[8003.20s -> 8005.24s]  It's definitely super helpful for me.
[8005.24s -> 8010.72s]  I'm excited to take this advice and like you said, use it and apply it to myself
[8010.72s -> 8015.52s]  and, um, share the results with everyone listening and see what happens from it.
[8015.52s -> 8020.04s]  But yeah, I just, I really appreciate the time and for everyone listening, I still
[8020.04s -> 8023.80s]  have about a page of notes at least that we didn't even touch on.
[8024.40s -> 8027.20s]  So if you want, if you enjoyed this conversation, let us know.
[8027.20s -> 8030.92s]  And if you want to hear us talk about Dan's spray wall and how he thinks
[8030.92s -> 8034.16s]  about setting up a spray wall, his he's got one of the most unique
[8034.16s -> 8035.52s]  spray walls I've ever seen.
[8035.60s -> 8036.44s]  That's a teaser.
[8036.92s -> 8041.00s]  Um, so if you're curious about that, I was curious to hear about your time
[8041.00s -> 8046.08s]  management and what you focus your time on when you are limited on time.
[8046.08s -> 8048.68s]  Cause I was surprised to hear that you're not spending much time climbing
[8048.68s -> 8051.48s]  on your board because you're focused the little time that
[8051.48s -> 8052.92s]  you have on other priorities.
[8053.76s -> 8058.40s]  Um, if you want to hear us talk about outdoor tactics and finding
[8058.40s -> 8062.24s]  boulders and highball mindset, there's so much we could talk about.
[8062.24s -> 8064.00s]  So yeah, if you guys want that, let us know.
[8064.00s -> 8068.52s]  And, uh, hopefully we can, we can do a round two, but for now.
[8069.08s -> 8069.80s]  I appreciate you.
[8069.80s -> 8070.68s]  Thanks so much.
[8070.92s -> 8071.16s]  Yeah.
[8073.96s -> 8074.60s]  What was that?
[8075.32s -> 8078.36s]  But if I'm a boring bastard and people are sick of listening to me,
[8078.64s -> 8079.36s]  rub it on them.
[8079.40s -> 8079.60s]  Yeah.
[8079.88s -> 8080.32s]  I'm happy.
[8080.32s -> 8080.64s]  Yeah.
[8081.00s -> 8082.84s]  Just the crack on in silence.
[8086.24s -> 8088.24s]  There's, there's a lot of geeks out there, man.
[8088.24s -> 8092.24s]  I think people are going to be psyched, um, to test their fingers
[8092.24s -> 8095.20s]  and to, uh, get into this in cut.
[8095.96s -> 8096.36s]  I'm sorry.
[8096.36s -> 8097.68s]  High angle, high angle crimp training.
[8097.68s -> 8098.52s]  I think it'll be great.
[8098.64s -> 8099.48s]  So, yeah.
[8101.20s -> 8101.92s]  Think, uh, yeah.
[8101.96s -> 8104.24s]  So just, and just, yeah, to finish for yourself.
[8104.80s -> 8108.92s]  I think the main thing, if anyone can take anything away from when you split
[8108.92s -> 8114.84s]  your grip up, just the main thing is making sure you just copy and paste
[8114.84s -> 8119.40s]  that when you break it apart to be as applicable as possible, and then you
[8119.40s -> 8123.48s]  should hit the, you should stimulate the right nerves and you should wake stuff
[8123.48s -> 8128.04s]  up and then when you can wake stuff up, you'll hit those parts that have been,
[8128.40s -> 8133.40s]  you know, a bit sleepy and everyone's got sleepy parts of that game, you know?
[8133.40s -> 8138.64s]  So, and, and you know what, we're not all going to end up at 49 days, but what
[8138.64s -> 8142.48s]  I would say is surely everyone can get a bit more progression out of their
[8142.48s -> 8148.76s]  fingers if they find like the slack and sleepy parts and, and, um, what's
[8148.76s -> 8152.40s]  cool for you, especially with your middle finger is, um, that's like a
[8152.40s -> 8155.84s]  finger that can take a lot of load biologically, you know, it's the,
[8156.16s -> 8157.04s]  it's the big strong one.
[8157.88s -> 8162.52s]  So for you, I think it's something to do with like the way you've got into
[8162.56s -> 8167.48s]  climbing and a bit of like the way you sort of stimulate your grip and maybe
[8167.48s -> 8172.12s]  you just haven't had loads of dynamic, high impact load that's forced it to
[8172.12s -> 8173.36s]  sort of wake up a bit.
[8174.40s -> 8179.08s]  And I think that would be dangerous to just jump on, like, just be looking
[8179.08s -> 8181.96s]  around, like loading up like one arm.
[8182.16s -> 8186.76s]  I used to do this thing where I just could jump and drive campus runs on one
[8187.72s -> 8189.28s]  crazy to think I used to do that now.
[8189.88s -> 8195.96s]  Um, but, uh, yeah, so just capturing that feeling and making sure that that's
[8195.96s -> 8199.84s]  what you copy and paste onto your training, um, is the best way of, if
[8199.84s -> 8203.24s]  you're going to split your grip up and stuff, just try and do that.
[8203.60s -> 8207.76s]  And, uh, I'll leave it there because hopefully that's probably my best
[8207.76s -> 8212.04s]  takeaway point on that note though, maybe we should end with some goals for me.
[8212.04s -> 8215.28s]  So for the pinky open hand, I'm at 16 kilos.
[8215.28s -> 8219.96s]  I'm going to try to get up to 20, like you said, and then my middle finger in
[8219.96s -> 8224.84s]  a crimp position is currently at about 16 kilos, 16 and a half.
[8225.36s -> 8226.52s]  What's a good goal for me?
[8226.56s -> 8227.36s]  You think with that?
[8227.36s -> 8230.16s]  And I'm, I'm thinking long-term I'm thinking like over the next couple
[8230.16s -> 8231.40s]  of years, something to work towards.
[8231.96s -> 8232.68s]  Couple of years.
[8233.08s -> 8233.44s]  Okay.
[8233.44s -> 8239.84s]  A couple of years above 25 and shorter term, two to three kilo jump.
[8240.16s -> 8240.48s]  Okay.
[8241.16s -> 8242.24s]  In six months.
[8243.20s -> 8243.44s]  Okay.
[8243.48s -> 8248.76s]  Ish, but that's partly because I think there's something that, um, and that's
[8248.76s -> 8255.24s]  where, um, yeah, I feel like the middle should pick up more and it can certainly
[8255.24s -> 8258.40s]  handle that kind of load for your body weight and things like that.
[8258.40s -> 8261.60s]  So I feel, I feel like that's not too crazy.
[8262.04s -> 8267.28s]  And certainly that's the type of numbers you'll see on, um, stronger
[8267.28s -> 8269.00s]  boulders in sort of the mid eight.
[8269.20s -> 8274.20s]  Um, is that kind of, if it's not on that finger, it will be on say the
[8274.20s -> 8277.56s]  pinky or something like that, you know, like the load will, you'll get there.
[8277.96s -> 8285.36s]  Um, so, and this is, this is why you see like 138% body weight scores and
[8285.36s -> 8288.72s]  things like that on some, uh, dead hangs and stuff, because like the pinky
[8288.72s -> 8294.96s]  will just take 40 kilos or something off 50 when it's things like that.
[8294.96s -> 8301.56s]  But, um, you know, it's all load displacement and stuff, but, um, yeah.
[8301.60s -> 8310.64s]  So for you 25 long, you know, like two years ago and then pinky, I would say.
[8311.72s -> 8312.76s]  Cause that's flexed.
[8312.88s -> 8315.48s]  And then pinky, I would say open.
[8316.12s -> 8319.72s]  I would say, yeah, above 20 is that's a little bit harder.
[8319.72s -> 8322.48s]  You've got to be a bit more careful with the pinky and strain it as well.
[8323.08s -> 8324.68s]  A little bit easier than the middle.
[8324.68s -> 8325.88s]  I feel it's got less.
[8326.04s -> 8329.08s]  It hasn't got the same support that the middle house can't draw
[8329.08s -> 8331.36s]  from the other fingers as easily.
[8331.60s -> 8334.96s]  So it's only got the ring to pull on, which is genetically tied to anyway.
[8335.96s -> 8341.08s]  Um, so, uh, yeah, 20 kilos.
[8341.12s -> 8346.68s]  And then if you could get like, yeah, I would say that's a safe goal.
[8346.76s -> 8352.08s]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't say like how much above 22 would be like pushing things.
[8352.48s -> 8352.80s]  Okay.
[8352.96s -> 8359.00s]  Um, but if you take that and you could apply that to half crimp, I think you've
[8359.00s -> 8365.72s]  just, what if you just bought yourself like, um, uh, maybe like 10 kilos of
[8365.72s -> 8370.80s]  body weight, which is probably going to be the difference between one arm
[8370.80s -> 8374.84s]  dead hanging and hopefully it'll be the difference between the main thing you
[8374.84s -> 8380.24s]  want is grip shouldn't be failing on most of those sort of five 14s and up.
[8380.60s -> 8380.92s]  Right.
[8381.28s -> 8385.36s]  Um, uh, so yeah, that's the best way of looking at it.
[8385.40s -> 8388.84s]  I think it's like, what sort of load are you going to be putting through
[8388.84s -> 8392.48s]  your fingers on those routes and when, and how can you keep failure at bay?
[8394.28s -> 8399.84s]  But the thing I really shouldn't talk about is, uh, really climbing
[8400.00s -> 8401.80s]  fitness, power, stuff like that.
[8403.68s -> 8405.08s]  I can't, I can't help you there.
[8405.16s -> 8408.36s]  Just get like some person that's been climbing for like two days on routes
[8408.36s -> 8409.32s]  and they'll give you better advice.
[8411.92s -> 8413.20s]  This has been amazing, man.
[8413.24s -> 8418.40s]  I'm really excited to, uh, to integrate some of this stuff and I'll just be, I'll
[8418.40s -> 8422.44s]  just be grinding away with my finger training per usual, and I'll keep all you
[8422.44s -> 8424.88s]  guys posted, but thanks again, Dan.
